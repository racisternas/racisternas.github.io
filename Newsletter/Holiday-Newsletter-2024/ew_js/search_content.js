The main event of the winter was the installation of solar panels on my roof by Sunrun in February. I finally was wooed to go solar and sign a lease for 20 years. It turned out to be a good idea because inflation has gone up quite a bit in 2022 and the monthly installment price is already better than the bill from the electric company would have been. woo-hoo! In February, I visited Fallen Star. Fallen Star is one of the most prominent art installations in the UCSD campus. It is a little house teetering at an angle on the edge of the Engineering 1 building. The original image of the solar eclipse has been processed adding contrast to make the earthshine visible amidst the sun corona's glare. This is the view of Santiago from the AirBnB where I stayed. However exciting the total solar eclipse was, it was over in a few minutes. That was our cue to pack up our gear, grab some lunch and head to the bus station to board a bus to Mazatlán where we spent the night. The next morning, we took a second bus to Los Mochis which traversed the entirety of the famous state of Sinaloa from South to North. Now, you may remember the name Sinaloa because of the rather infamous Sinaloa cartel. So here we are on a bus heading north the main highway in the state of Sinaloa, and you would be correct to guess that we would have an encounter with the Sinaloa Cartel minions. It only amounted to our bus being inspected twice by the cartel people and I having a disicussion with a cartel guy because he insisted our pasports were not right. Tourists form other countries did not fare so well and were shaken down for bribes or risk being left by the side of the road. By and by, we arrived to Los Mochis and the next day we boarded a shuttle to the town of El Fuerte which, the leyend goes, is the birthplace of the famous folk hero El Zorro. As a matter of fact we spent the night in the hotel Posada del Hidalgo which was owned by the De La Vega family and where Diego (El Zorro), was born. All that to say that the hotel is a beautiful estate with gardens and that the dinner time entertainment includes a show with El Zorro himself or at least an actor dressed as the hero. For the last three years, Santiago has had some of the strictest health care measures in Latin America so much so that in March 2022 people were still required to wear a face mask everywhere, even while walking down the street. That was surprising to me because Chile also had one of the highest rates of Covid vaccinations in the world. The Ministry of Health also required a \"mobilty pass\" that needed to be shown at the entrance to every gathering place like a restaurant to prove vaccination status. However, after two years of the Covid pandemic, the restaurants in Santiago were all packed with people eager to get on with their lives. Winter sunsets in the desert are usually spectacular. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... . 2022 promised to deliver us back to our pre-pandemic lives but instead it broke our hearts. We had Putin invading Ukraine, the economy suffering, and multiple problems in many parts of the world. But we also saw stories of courage, and passion, and creativity. People helping complete strangers, astounding new forms of AI-assisted art being created, new and exciting medical treatments being developed. We saw the JWST send us back the most beautiful images from the end of the universe and the beginning of time. It is an exciting time to be alive! I wish a much better New Year to all of you, with adventure, surprises, happiness, and full of creative possibilities. I hope for a year where your life is fulfilling and you get to enjoy the company of those you love. Have a great 2023! (and drop me a line when you can) In January, John Zagarella (my former boss at 24 hour fitness) and I went to the Anza Borrego desert. We visited the Borrego Palm Canyon oasis and also stunning Font's Point with its commanding view of the badlands. The badlands extend for many miles towards the East in the direction of the Salton Sea. 2024 was like no previous year for me. I had just retired in August 2023 and I wanted to do something awesome for my first full year of retirement. I had dreamed to visit Namibia for serveral years. Why Namibia? The short answer is because it is a land of amazing landscapes, wild animals, giant sand dunes, clear skies and incredible coastline. Also, it is one of the safest places in Africa and is, as I would soon find out, remarkably clean. So I signed up for a fantastic two-week photographic tour of Namibia and then came the realization: if I am going all the way to Africa for the first time in my life, I should visit some other country in that continent, and I signed up for a two-week tour of Morocco. But wait, I thought, if I am to spend two weeks in Morocco, at the end of the trip I will be a stone throw away from Spain so a ticket to Madrid was secured. But, if I make it to Spain, I thought, surely I should visit Portugal as well because it is a fascinating country that I know very little of. And of course 10 days in Portugal would be so nicely followed by a visit to France and, why not, Italy as well. And lo and behold, the trip of a lifetime had become a mini world tour spanning two months and two continents. However, before my world trip started in May, there were a few other adventures in store. By the way, some of the pictures can be seen in full screen if you click on them (a new tab will open). The little house has a small garden and it is tilted at an angle. The intention of the Korean-born artist was to portray the unease of the immigrant experience where everything seems off balance. In March, I travelled to Chile to visit my Mom. Here she is sitting on the left, dining out with some of her friends. This group of friends are all physicians who were Mom's students at the University of Chile 50 years ago. Late in 2023, my Friend Bill Heidler asked me a question: Would you be interested in seeing the total solar eclipse in Mexico in 2024? Of course, I said yes but then he followed up with \"how about a tour of Mexico's Copper Canyon\". What can you say to that but yes again? So in April of 2024 Bill, his wife Pam, and I flew to Durango, Mexico to observe the eclipse. It was my first opportunity to see a solar eclipse and it was spectacular. The sun kept getting dimmer until, all of a sudden, there was this massive black hole in the sky surrounded by fire. An extraordinary sight. Bill, Pam and I waiting for totality half an hour before the solar eclipse. Santa Bárbara Bridge Here we are playing our part as the gringo tourists hanging out with El Zorro and his beautiful assistant. The engine of \"El Chepe\" After two nights en El Fuerte which included a rafting trip down the Fuerte River, we boarded \"El Chepe\". That is the name of the tourist train that travels along the Copper Canyon in a route that links the town of El Fuerte near the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) to the town of Creel in the state of Chihuahua. We only rode the train as far as Bahuichivo because we had programmed visits to several points of the Sierra Tarahumara such as Cerocahui, Mirador del Gallego, Divisadero and the Copper Canyon Adventure Park where we took the zip line and hanging bridges circuit. It was a lot of fun. The zip line circuit included 10 different zip lines and two hanging bridges. The longest zip line reached a speed of 65 miles an hour. We flew back to California via the Tijuana Airport and the International Bridge. If you ever want to fly to Cancún or Mexico City, the Tijuana Airport will have any flight you may need within Mexico for a fraction of the cost of flying out of San Diego. In May, I made sure I had all the i's dotted and t's crossed before I started my world trip. First stop, Namibia. A two-month trip away from home requires a lot of planning. Vaccinations, travel and extraction insurance, malaria prevention pills, passport, tickets, luggage and all my photo equipment. I could not forget anything since some of the places I would visit were very remote. Also, my plans included 10 individual airline flights, several train rides, car rentals and buses so I could not afford to carry too many pieces of luggage either. As you may imagine, there is no direct flight from San Diego to Wyndhoek and most flights to the Namibian capital go through London and Johannesburg so the total trip ends up being 32 hours of mostly sleepless travel. My Namibia photo workshop consisted of a journey of over 2000 kms. on a small bus all over Namibia with a group of photographers that were just as excited as me to see the beautiful places of that country. I took so many pictures during the 17 days I spent in Namibia in so many different locations that I will just put a small sample of them here. The main take away fpr me is that Namibia is an extraordinary country full of wonderful scenery and amazing fauna. It is also very safe and surprisingly very very clean. That makes it a perfect destination for first-time travellers to sub-saharan Africa. The members of our group standing under the sign that marks the latitude of the tropic of Capricorn. Nighttime view of the Quiver Tree Forest. Three views of the abandoned mining town of Kolmanskop. The old buildings are being slowly swallowed by the sands. The Milky Way over Namib Rand Reserve. This is the cinder cone called Chocolate Mountain in Namib Rand Reserve. Dune 45 in Sossusvlei National Park. These are the largest and oldest sand dunes in the world. Some of the sand dunes can be over 300 meters high. their color is red because of rusted iron particles in the sand. Nighttime at Deadvlei. Deadvlei is a small area of Sossusvlei National Park where a grove of dead trees still stands after 1,000 years. The trees were killed when a shift in the sand dunes closed off the river that fed their small valley. The dead trees stand on a layer of salt and are preserved by the dry weather. Their small valley is surrounded on all sides by giant red sand dunes. Notice how the passage of time quickly changes the light conditions and dramatically alters the perceived colors of the landscape. Giant sand dunes are formed when the wind blows predominantly in two opposite directions forming a consistent sand pile that does not change much from year to year. I took this picture from a helicopter. Early morning in Deadvlei Sunrise at Deadvlei The helicopter ride took me across the giant Namib Sand Sea all the way to the Atlantic Coast. One of the remarkable features of the Namibia Coast is that in most places the giant sand dunes reach all the way to the Ocean leaving just a thin strand of beach. The Three Fingers. A dry river flows past the giant dunes. a The next stop in the trip was Walvis Bay, a port city on the coast of Namibia. Since most of the land facing the Atlantic Ocean is covered in giant sand dunes, the number of coastal cities or ports is limited. In Walvis Bay we got up well before dawn to visit the Namib-Naukluft National Park and its beautiful sand dunes. We climbed the dunes before dawn to capture the soft pre-dawnw light. A Springbok trotting up a sand dune. Walvis Bay has a salt water lagoon that is frequented by two species of Flamingos. These are the Lesser Flamingos. Our next stop was Spitzkoppe, a rock formation that stands out in the plains of northern Namibia. We camped out there for a night which allowed us to take pictures after sundown and early the next morning. The last stop of my Namibia trip was truly spectacular. Etosha National Park is a veritable jewel. Etosha is home to an abundance of wildlife and I was very fortunate to enjoy sightings of many different species and also to be able to capture them in my pictures. It is extraordinary to be so close to so many beautiful animals. A couple of Springbok drinking at dawn. Lion cubs A Zebra family Lilac Breasted Roller A female Dik-dik Purple Breasted Roller I left Namibia very impressed with the country, the sights and its people. The next stop in my trip was Morocco. Although Namibia and Morocco are both on the Atlantic coast of Africa, it is a very big continent and there are no direct flights. So, I began my odyssey through South Africa and Egypt to get to Namibia. Hey, it only took about 18 hours to get to Morocco, a lot less than the series of flights that landed me in Wyndhoek in 30 hours. One of the few highlights of the trip to Morocco was the approach to Cairo Airport which afforded me a glimpse of the pyramids through the plane window. My first stop in Morocco was Casablanca a city of 3.2 million people on the Atlantic Coast. Indisputably, the most beautiful building in the city of Casablanca is the Hassan II mosque built in the mid-1990s on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. In fact, part of the building is resting on columns that are placed in the waters. This is a reference to a Quranic verse that says that God's throne rests upojn the waters. It is an enormous building that can house 30,000 people and is sorrounded by a large esplanade where an additional 70,000 can join for prayers during mayor holidays. The interior of the mosque was built by local artusans using domestic materials. The different types of stone have beautiful colors and the carvings are beautifully proportioned and exquisitely detailed. At night, the mosque is illuminated throughout. There is a green laser beam at the top of the minaret that shines its light in the direction of Mecca so the faithful can know in which direction to pray. I spent 2 weeks in Morocco in a tour organized by Intrepid Travel. I ghad a great experience and got to see quite a bit of the country. I will include just a few of the pictures I took there. But Morocco is to be experienced as more than a collection of beautiful buildings. There are markets, and foods, interesting customs, etc. On the right is a picture of the Mausoleum of Mohammad V in Rabat which houses the tombs of three kings. The mausoleum has an honor guard (at the door with red cape) and a man on duty reading the scriptures (dressed in white). The picture below corresponds to a minaret built by Sultan Yaqub Al-Mansur in the 12th century. It is on the same grounds as the mausoleum. The Mosque was destroyed in an earthquake and only the square minaret remains. The columns were built with stones scavenged from various roman ruins.","tags":"","url":"index.html","UUID":"EC9A6696605244E98BBAA9F46BC92737"}]};
