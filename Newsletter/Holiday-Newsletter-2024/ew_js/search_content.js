The main event of the winter was the installation of solar panels on my roof by Sunrun in February. I finally was wooed to go solar and sign a lease for 20 years. It turned out to be a good idea because inflation has gone up quite a bit in 2022 and the monthly installment price is already better than the bill from the electric company would have been. woo-hoo! In February, I visited Fallen Star. Fallen Star is one of the most prominent art installations in the UCSD campus. It is a little house teetering at an angle on the edge of the Engineering 1 building. The original image of the solar eclipse has been processed adding contrast to make the earthshine visible amidst the sun coronas glare. This is the view of Santiago from the AirBnB where I stayed. However exciting the total solar eclipse was, it was over in a few minutes. That was our cue to pack up our gear, grab some lunch and head to the bus station to board a bus to Mazatlán where we spent the night. The next morning, we took a second bus to Los Mochis which traversed the entirety of the famous state of Sinaloa from South to North. Now, you may remember the name Sinaloa because of the rather infamous Sinaloa cartel. So here we are on a bus heading north the main highway in the state of Sinaloa, and you would be correct to guess that we would have an encounter with the Sinaloa Cartel minions. It only amounted to our bus being inspected twice by the cartel people and I having a disicussion with a cartel guy because he insisted our pasports were not right. Tourists form other countries did not fare so well and were shaken down for bribes or risk being left by the side of the road. By and by, we arrived to Los Mochis and the next day we boarded a shuttle to the town of El Fuerte which, the leyend goes, is the birthplace of the famous folk hero El Zorro. As a matter of fact we spent the night in the hotel Posada del Hidalgo which was owned by the De La Vega family and where Diego (El Zorro), was born. All that to say that the hotel is a beautiful estate with gardens and that the dinner time entertainment includes a show with El Zorro himself or at least an actor dressed as the hero. For the last three years, Santiago has had some of the strictest health care measures in Latin America so much so that in March 2022 people were still required to wear a face mask everywhere, even while walking down the street. That was surprising to me because Chile also had one of the highest rates of Covid vaccinations in the world. The Ministry of Health also required a \"mobilty pass\" that needed to be shown at the entrance to every gathering place like a restaurant to prove vaccination status. However, after two years of the Covid pandemic, the restaurants in Santiago were all packed with people eager to get on with their lives. Winter sunsets in the desert are usually spectacular. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... . 2022 promised to deliver us back to our pre-pandemic lives but instead it broke our hearts. We had Putin invading Ukraine, the economy suffering, and multiple problems in many parts of the world. But we also saw stories of courage, and passion, and creativity. People helping complete strangers, astounding new forms of AI-assisted art being created, new and exciting medical treatments being developed. We saw the JWST send us back the most beautiful images from the end of the universe and the beginning of time. It is an exciting time to be alive! I wish a much better New Year to all of you, with adventure, surprises, happiness, and full of creative possibilities. I hope for a year where your life is fulfilling and you get to enjoy the company of those you love. Have a great 2023! (and drop me a line when you can) In January, John Zagarella (my former boss at 24 hour fitness) and I went to the Anza Borrego desert. We visited the Borrego Palm Canyon oasis and also stunning Fonts Point with its commanding view of the badlands. The badlands extend for many miles towards the East in the direction of the Salton Sea. 2024 was like no previous year for me. I had just retired in August 2023 and I wanted to do something awesome for my first full year of retirement. I had dreamed to visit Namibia for serveral years. Why Namibia? The short answer is because it is a land of amazing landscapes, wild animals, giant sand dunes, clear skies and incredible coastline. Also, it is one of the safest places in Africa and is, as I would soon find out, remarkably clean. So I signed up for a fantastic two-week photographic tour of Namibia and then came the realization: if I am going all the way to Africa for the first time in my life, I should visit some other country in that continent, and I signed up for a two-week tour of Morocco. But wait, I thought, if I am to spend two weeks in Morocco, at the end of the trip I will be a stone throw away from Spain so a ticket to Madrid was secured. But, if I make it to Spain, I thought, surely I should visit Portugal as well because it is a fascinating country that I know very little of. And of course 10 days in Portugal would be so nicely followed by a visit to France and, why not, Italy as well. And lo and behold, the trip of a lifetime had become a mini world tour spanning two months and two continents. However, before my world trip started in May, there were a few other adventures in store. By the way, some of the pictures can be seen in full screen if you click on them (a new tab will open). The little house has a small garden and it is tilted at an angle. The intention of the Korean-born artist was to portray the unease of the immigrant experience where everything seems off balance. In March, I travelled to Chile to visit my Mom. Here she is sitting on the left, dining out with some of her friends. This group of friends are all physicians who were Moms students at the University of Chile 50 years ago. Late in 2023, my Friend Bill Heidler asked me a question: Would you be interested in seeing the total solar eclipse in Mexico in 2024? Of course, I said yes but then he followed up with \"how about a tour of Mexicos Copper Canyon\". What can you say to that but yes again? So in April of 2024 Bill, his wife Pam, and I flew to Durango, Mexico to observe the eclipse. It was my first opportunity to see a solar eclipse and it was spectacular. The sun kept getting dimmer until, all of a sudden, there was this massive black hole in the sky surrounded by fire. An extraordinary sight. Bill, Pam and I waiting for totality half an hour before the solar eclipse. Santa Bárbara Bridge Here we are playing our part as the gringo tourists hanging out with El Zorro and his beautiful assistant. The engine of \"El Chepe\" After two nights en El Fuerte which included a rafting trip down the Fuerte River, we boarded \"El Chepe\". That is the name of the tourist train that travels along the Copper Canyon in a route that links the town of El Fuerte near the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) to the town of Creel in the state of Chihuahua. We only rode the train as far as Bahuichivo because we had programmed visits to several points of the Sierra Tarahumara such as Cerocahui, Mirador del Gallego, Divisadero and the Copper Canyon Adventure Park where we took the zip line and hanging bridges circuit. It was a lot of fun. The zip line circuit included 10 different zip lines and two hanging bridges. The longest zip line reached a speed of 65 miles an hour. We flew back to California via the Tijuana Airport and the International Bridge. If you ever want to fly to Cancún or Mexico City, the Tijuana Airport will have any flight you may need within Mexico for a fraction of the cost of flying out of San Diego. In May, I made sure I had all the is dotted and ts crossed before I started my world trip. First stop, Namibia. A two-month trip away from home requires a lot of planning. Vaccinations, travel and extraction insurance, malaria prevention pills, passport, tickets, luggage and all my photo equipment. I could not forget anything since some of the places I would visit were very remote. Also, my plans included 10 individual airline flights, several train rides, car rentals and buses so I could not afford to carry too many pieces of luggage either. As you may imagine, there is no direct flight from San Diego to Wyndhoek and most flights to the Namibian capital go through London and Johannesburg so the total trip ends up being 32 hours of mostly sleepless travel. My Namibia photo workshop consisted of a journey of over 2000 kms. on a small bus all over Namibia with a group of photographers that were just as excited as me to see the beautiful places of that country. I took so many pictures during the 17 days I spent in Namibia in so many different locations that I will just put a small sample of them here. The main take away fpr me is that Namibia is an extraordinary country full of wonderful scenery and amazing fauna. It is also very safe and surprisingly very very clean. That makes it a perfect destination for first-time travellers to sub-saharan Africa. The members of our group standing under the sign that marks the latitude of the tropic of Capricorn. Nighttime view of the Quiver Tree Forest. Three views of the abandoned mining town of Kolmanskop. The old buildings are being slowly swallowed by the sands. The Milky Way over Namib Rand Reserve. This is the cinder cone called Chocolate Mountain in Namib Rand Reserve. Dune 45 in Sossusvlei National Park. These are the largest and oldest sand dunes in the world. Some of the sand dunes can be over 300 meters high. their color is red because of rusted iron particles in the sand. Nighttime at Deadvlei. Deadvlei is a small area of Sossusvlei National Park where a grove of dead trees still stands after 1,000 years. The trees were killed when a shift in the sand dunes closed off the river that fed their small valley. The dead trees stand on a layer of salt and are preserved by the dry weather. Their small valley is surrounded on all sides by giant red sand dunes. Notice how the passage of time quickly changes the light conditions and dramatically alters the perceived colors of the landscape. Giant sand dunes are formed when the wind blows predominantly in two opposite directions forming a consistent sand pile that does not change much from year to year. I took this picture from a helicopter. Early morning in Deadvlei Sunrise at Deadvlei The helicopter ride took me across the giant Namib Sand Sea all the way to the Atlantic Coast. One of the remarkable features of the Namibia Coast is that in most places the giant sand dunes reach all the way to the Ocean leaving just a thin strand of beach. The Three Fingers. A dry river flows past the giant dunes. a The next stop in the trip was Walvis Bay, a port city on the coast of Namibia. Since most of the land facing the Atlantic Ocean is covered in giant sand dunes, the number of coastal cities or ports is limited. In Walvis Bay we got up well before dawn to visit the Namib-Naukluft National Park and its beautiful sand dunes. We climbed the dunes before dawn to capture the soft pre-dawnw light. A Springbok trotting up a sand dune. Walvis Bay has a salt water lagoon that is frequented by two species of Flamingos. These are the Lesser Flamingos. Our next stop was Spitzkoppe, a rock formation that stands out in the plains of northern Namibia. We camped out there for a night which allowed us to take pictures after sundown and early the next morning. The last stop of my Namibia trip was truly spectacular. Etosha National Park is a veritable jewel. Etosha is home to an abundance of wildlife and I was very fortunate to enjoy sightings of many different species and also to be able to capture them in my pictures. It is extraordinary to be so close to so many beautiful animals. A couple of Springbok drinking at dawn. Lion cubs A Zebra family Lilac Breasted Roller A female Dik-dik Purple Breasted Roller I left Namibia very impressed with the country, the sights and its people. The next stop in my trip was Morocco. Although Namibia and Morocco are both on the Atlantic coast of Africa, it is a very big continent and there are no direct flights. So, I began my odyssey through South Africa and Egypt to get to Namibia. Hey, it only took about 18 hours to get to Morocco, a lot less than the series of flights that landed me in Wyndhoek in 30 hours. One of the few highlights of the trip to Morocco was the approach to Cairo Airport which afforded me a glimpse of the pyramids through the plane window. My first stop in Morocco was Casablanca a city of 3.2 million people on the Atlantic Coast. Indisputably, the most beautiful building in the city of Casablanca is the Hassan II mosque built in the mid-1990s on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. In fact, part of the building is resting on columns that are placed in the waters. This is a reference to a Quranic verse that says that Gods throne rests upojn the waters. It is an enormous building that can house 30,000 people and is sorrounded by a large esplanade where an additional 70,000 can join for prayers during mayor holidays. The interior of the mosque was built by local artusans using domestic materials. The different types of stone have beautiful colors and the carvings are beautifully proportioned and exquisitely detailed. At night, the mosque is illuminated throughout. There is a green laser beam at the top of the minaret that shines its light in the direction of Mecca so the faithful can know in which direction to pray. I spent 2 weeks in Morocco in a tour organized by Intrepid Travel. I had a great experience and got to see quite a bit of the country. I will include just a few of the pictures I took there. But Morocco is to be experienced as more than a collection of beautiful buildings. There are markets, and foods, interesting customs, etc. On the right is a picture of the Mausoleum of Mohammad V in Rabat which houses the tombs of three kings. The mausoleum has an honor guard (at the door with red cape) and a man on duty reading the scriptures (dressed in white). The picture below corresponds to a square minaret built by Sultan Yaqub Al-Mansur in the 12th century. It is on the same grounds as the mausoleum. The Mosque was destroyed in an earthquake and only the square minaret remains. The columns were built with stones scavenged from various roman ruins. Square minarets were a style unique to the Almohad dynasty which also they used in mosques in Marrakesh and Seville. Three small views of the enormous Medina in Marakesh, a place where every thing imaginable is for sale and where there is activity all day long and well into the night. Medina is the name given to the old portion of a town. Most cities in Morocco have a Medina. One of the stops in our Morocco tour was on the edge of the Sahara desert where we got to ride camels and feel a little like Lawrence of Arabia. It was 45 C and we got sandblasted but I would not miss it for anything. This is the famous Kasbah Amridil, a famous medieval fortress that has belonged to the same family for centuries. It has been used to film many movies, think for example Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Mission Impossible II. This is the Ksar Aït-Ben-Haddou, a 17th century village which has also been used in multiple movies and TV shows including Game of Thrones, The Man Who Would Be King and Gladiator 1 and 2 among others. The merchants have a list of the movies with pictures as a sign of local pride. The tour of Morocco concluded in Marrakesh. There were countless little experiences, sights and excursions during those two weeks in Morocco but there is no room to tell them all here. It was the time to leave Africa and travel to Europe. The next destination was Madrid, Spain. I had visited Spain more than a few times but had never made it to Madrid so the city was a wonderful surprise to me. It is full of great neighborhoods, extensive parks, fountains, ancient gates, lovely buildings along La Gran Vía, and full of life and excitement all day and all night. The picture on the right was taken from the roof of the Palacio de Cibeles (former Telecommunications Ministry) which is in front of the great fountain of Las Cibeles as seen in the picture. Just beyond that is the beginning of La Gran Vía, a bustling commercial center. This is the castle of the King of Spain. It is the largest castle in Europe. View from the roof of Palacio Las Cibeles, Madrid. The Puerta de Alcalá, one of the old gateways to Madrid. This is the Roman aqueduct in Segovia, which delivered water from 100 CE until 1973. 19 centuries of service. That is great engineering. After touring Madrid mostly on foot for a few days, I went to visit my old friend David Szanto whi lives in a town nearby. I finally got to meet his family and he was so generous with his time that he took be to a number of nearby cities and towns in the region. Portugal was my next destination after Spain. This was my first visit to Portugal so I wanted to sample different regions. I started in the Algarve, in the Southern part of the country, with its beautiful coast and pristine beaches. On the right is the little beach in Paradise Cave. I took a sunset cruise in a boat that was small enough to motor in an out of a number of caves and inlets to get a better view of this rugged and beautiful part of the coast. Afterwards, I visited Lisbon, the Capital of Portugal. Just like Madrid, Lisbon was also once the capital of a vast empire. My next stop in Portugal was Sintra, a city of old regal palaces and moorish forts. The palaces have beautiful designs and colors that make it look like something out of a fairy tale. The town itself looks like a movie set -- it is both charming and beautiful. The arch of Rua Augusta at the Commerce Square Beautiful elevator of Santa Justa. It is similar to one found in Valparaiso, Chile but with more beautiful designs. The view from the top of the elevator of Santa Justa across the old town. At the top of the hill is the medieval Castle of Saint George. In the hilly neighborhood of Santa Apolonia the old trolleys still run up the hills. This is the monument to the discoveries that celebrates the centuries of conquest when Portugal was a growing empire. This is the Tower of Belem where the Portuguese navigators of the 15th and 16th centuries set sail. I ended my visit to Portugal in the city of Porto, in the northern part of the country. Quinta da Regaleira has incredible gardens on a steep hilside. The gardens are full of pathways, caves, grottos, wells and other mysterious structures. One of the landmarks is the famous Initiation Well on the left. It is surrounded by a spiral staircase and is 88 feet deep. This is the main square of the town of Sintra. On top of the hill is the 10th century Moorish Castle that dates from the time of the Almohad occupation. Above and on the left are two pictures of the National Palace of Pena. Both inside and out is a fairy tale palace. Below left is the sculpture of Triton decorating the base of a bow window. One of the cobblestoned streets of Porto descending towards the Douro river. The interior of the Chardron bookshop (Lello & Irmao) which is billed as the most beautiful bookstore in the world. From Portugal I flew to Nantes in France. Nantes was historically an important harbor in the river Loire and also the location of the Palace of the Duchy of Britanny. Although I walked quite a bit around town, my main goal was to visit \"Les Machines de lÎlle\" an open air museum of steampunk giant robots that have become famous worldwide for their travelling exhibits. The Palace of the Duchy of Britanny Milan, Italy would be the last stage in my world trip. I flew to Nantes in France. It was quite a shock to go from rainy France to very hot and muggy Milan. That, and also the cab driver doing 150 km\/h on the way to the city and then charging me US$100 for the racing show. Milan is one of the most expensive places in Europe so I should not have been surprised. Milan is one of the most stylish cities in the world. It has been around for 26 centuries and has the buildings and artwork to prove it. It would take another web page of pictures to give a glimpse of the city so I will just include some interesting sights. On the right is a fragment of the original Last Supper from Leonardo Da Vinci. Yes, it looks flaky but at 500 years of age it still is impressive. Below and to the right are two views of the Duomo of Milan. the Cathedral is clad with white marble everywhere and the roof is covered with dozens of statues of saints and heroes. The last place I visited in France was the Mont Saint Michel Abbey. Visiting this 8th century abbey on an island off the Atlantic coast had long been a dream of mine. The sandy beach on the picture below floods with the high tide but during low tide it is possible to walk for several miles away from the coast. The place is a marvel of architecture. The tour of the buildings is very exhaustive including all the major rooms and their history. The tour includes the beautiful cloister pictured on the right. The Opera building in Rennes On the right, is the canal known as Naviglio Grande. it is 32 miles long and was built in the 23th century to bring water to the city from the Ticino river. It was also a major commercial route for the city. From Milan, I took the train to Piacenza where I spent a few days with my friend Paola and her children Eric and Luna. Piacenza is a lovely town far from the hordes of tourists in Milan. I had a great time there with Paola and her family and we had wonderful meals together. And with that, my time in Europe was up and it was time for me to head home. Of course, you never plan for the unexpected. In my case, I was due to fly back on July 19th a day which became infamous in the airline industry because of a bug in a Windows update that broke the software systems of most airlines. So I spent many hours wandering the lounges and terminals of Chicago Ohares airport until I finally boarded a plane to San Diego where I arrived so so late into the night. What do you do after a 2 month trip to six countries in 2 continents? You unpack your bags and begin processing the 8,000 pictures I took. Also, I began to plan my next adventure a road trip to Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada in September. Driving to Canada is very very easy. All you need is a good car and some patience. To break down the road trip time, I planned on viisiting several interesting places.","tags":"","url":"index.html","UUID":"EC9A6696605244E98BBAA9F46BC92737"}]};
