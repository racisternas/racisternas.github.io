There were trips and adventures, of course, also reunions with old friends, but most important, there was a major life transition: I retired after 42 years of writing software for a living. But before I get ahead of myself, let me tell you the story of 2023 in order. 2023 was a very rainy year in Southern California so much so that it rained every month until June and then we even had a rare Pacific Coast hurricane in August. All that rain caused the draught to end and kept the hills green throughout the entire Summer which is very rare in these parts. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... . 2022 promised to deliver us back to our pre-pandemic lives but instead it broke our hearts. We had Putin invading Ukraine, the economy suffering, and multiple problems in many parts of the world. But we also saw stories of courage, and passion, and creativity. People helping complete strangers, astounding new forms of AI-assisted art being created, new and exciting medical treatments being developed. We saw the JWST send us back the most beautiful images from the end of the universe and the beginning of time. It is an exciting time to be alive! I wish a much better New Year to all of you, with adventure, surprises, happiness, and full of creative possibilities. I hope for a year where your life is fulfilling and you get to enjoy the company of those you love. Have a great 2023! (and drop me a line when you can) In January , after an early storm, I drove to Palm Springs and tried to take the tram up Mount San Jacinto to see the snow fall. Of course, there were 10,000 other people who had the same idea so there were no tickets left. I ended up visiting the Palm Springs Air Museum. They have an excellent collection of airplanes from World War II and later. Also in January, I paid a visit to the Sunset Cliffs sea caves in San Diego. This part of the coast South of Ocean Beach is beautiful but can only be visited when the low tide is negative which only happens a few times every year. Only then, the water is low enough to enter the caves. This time, the low tide coincided with a sunny day caused by the Santa Ana winds. The bright light and the colors made for a beautiful outing. In February, I gave the San Jacinto tram another shot. This time, I was lucky and got to ride the tram up the mountain and enjoy the winter landscape. The tram climbs above 2800 mts. of elevation in a few minutes. It is amazing to leave the desert behind and rise above the snow line. The view from the top of the tram. The large fields of wind turbines are visible below on the desert floor. View of the San Jacinto mountains in the late afternoon. Here is Alexander, overwhelmed by the mountain. I took my small drone to Mount San Jacinto and flew it above the trees. Looking at the mountain from above gives you a whole new perspective of the landscape. In March, I headed to Chile to visit my Mom and some of my old friends from High School. These are H√©ctor Daniel and Carolina. Two of my friends from my High School days. My Mom is doing great, still enjoying her independence. She has picked up a new hobby that consists in freaking out her physician friends by refusing to get live in help. These are Marcelo and Irene, two of the medical doctors that Mom befriended when she taught at the medical school half a century ago. They somehow believe that I could convince my Mom to get live-in help. üòÇ I visited Valpara√≠so with my college friend Alejandro. We got some awesome food including the abalone salad below. The view of Valparaiso Bay was amazing. One of the old streets in Cerro La Concepci√≥n, Valpara√≠so. In April, I traveled to Minneapolis to visit Florence Littman, my former mother in law. Florence, now lives in a nice apartment in a senior residence not farm from her old home. Coincidentally, she celebrated her birthday while I was visiting. While I was away in Minnesotta, my pet corn snake Wiggles staged an escape from her vivarium. It was my fault for not locking the vivarium sliding door correctly while rushing out of the house to get to the airport. Wiggles proved to be very good at hiding. I set up a couple of video cameras with motion sensors and left water and a heating pad (snakes are ectothermic) as a lure. She did not show any interest and it took me three weeks to catch her. Even though she had not eaten anything during that entire time, Wiggles was unharmed. I was delighted that she was back. During May, I hiked around San Diego and took some fun pictures with my drone. Wiggles looks pretty innocent in this picture but no doubt she is planning her next escape.

I had submitted many pictures but only got two of them accepted to the exhibit. One of them got an Honorable Mention. It was an interesting experience to participate in the process from the submission of the photos to visiting the exhibit. It was very enjoyable to see all the different pictures including the winning entries in each category. My friend Kim Signoret-Paar won Best in Show with her picture of the streets of Hanoi Even though I have lived in San Diego county for 22 years this was my first time visiting the San Diego County fair. Outside the exhibit halls, the fair was exactly how you would imagine, loud rides, music, and greasy food. The winning trifecta of summer fun. In July, I had a chance to visit my old and esteemed friend Dr. Jos√© Quiroga in Los Angeles. He is a world reknown expert on torture and a Human Rights advocate. Pepe is one of the few survivors of the coup de etat that toppled the socialist regime in Chile 50 years ago. He was honored by the chilean president during the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the coup at the presidential palace in Santiago. By July, the cloudiness and gloominess that dominated the skies during the first half of 2023 was finally gone so it was time to enjoy the beaches in Carlsbad again. In August 11th, I quit my job and retired. I started working in 1980 so it took me a little while to get used to the rhythm of a weekday that is not filled with work activities. My last employer was 24 Hour Fitness a chain of health clubs with hundreds of gyms. That job was ok but what I truly miss are the people I worked with. For my last day of work, a bunch of my co-workers took me to happy hour. Here are three of the people who attended the send-off. Pablo, is a good friend from Mexico who works in the U.S. as for a major consultancy company. John was my boss at 24 Hour Fitness. A great guy who never loses his temper no matter the nonsense that may be happening. Rajeev is Johns both and is in charge of all software development and testing activities. Also, my good friends Kim Hutton and Jack Hoole invited me to dinner to celebrate my new freedom from work. Here, Jack and I are enjoying a great Peruvian dinner in Encinitas. The reason for the specific date of my retirement (August 11th) was that my college friend Alejandro Yachan was arriving the next day from Chile to visit me and we would be taking a road trip to Utah, Arizona and Colorado together. The trip covered 2200 miles, and included visits to 8 national parks and national monuments plus a number of state parks and some Navajo nation sites. I had a great time revisiting so many landmarks that I know and love. It was a great way to mark the end of my work life. The striking F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter. By the way, most of the pictures can be seen in full screen if you click on them. On the right is Alejandro standing next to a very muddy Virgin river in Zion National Park. The point where he stands is the start of the hike called The Narrows, one of the most popular hikes in any national park. It entails walking on the river bed of the Virgin river for several miles between the towering sandstone walls of the canyon. Here are some of the things we saw during our road trip. The sunset at Cape Royal in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Thors Hammer in Bryce Canyon National Park. Delicate Arch and Double Arch in Arches National Park Hickman Bridge in Capitol Reef National Park. The Strike Valley in Capitol Reef National Park. Metate Arch in Devils Playground State Park in Utah. The Strike Valley in Capitol Reef National Park. Grosvenor Arch along the Cottonwood Road in Utah Paria Valley, Arizona. Three views of Upper Antelope Canyon, Navajo Nation, Arizona. Notice the log stuck on the upper wall of the slot canyon during a flash flood (see left image). Goosenecks State Park in Utah Earlier in the year, when I flew to Minneapolis in April, I took a picture of Goosenecks on the San Luis River in Utah from the plane. Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado is one of the most extraordinary places we visited. It contains a large number of cliff dwellings from the Pueblo people, most of them dating from the 13th century. A couple of the villages can be visited with a park ranger. Exiting the villages requires some climbing on the side of the cliff as the picture on the right can attest. Monument Valley, Arizona during a full moon. Mesa Arch in Canyonlands National Park, Utah. The rest of September and October, I began to adjust to my \"new normal\" of life after work. The ocean was still warm so there was still plenty of time to visit the beach and swim in the waves. A San Diego Photograpy group had a meetup in Shelter Island in September to take pictures of the full moon rising behind the San Diego downtown skyline. The round building in the foreground is a helicopter hanger from the Coronado Naval Base. If you click on the picture, you will open it up in a new window where you will see a lot more detail including the mast of an aircraft carrier behind the plane hanger. Sadly, my friend Brad Lobitz passed away in September after a long illness. Brad, his wife Michele, and daughter Valeria had been friends with me since the mid 1990s. The picture on the right was taken more than 20 years ago but that is how I will always remember Brad: always fit, energetic and in a good mood. Michele decided to have a memorial gathering for Brad in their home in Mount Vernon, WA and I was invited. I did not think twice and planned to be there. Another important event in October is Halloween. My neighborhood is very popular with trick or treaters and this year it was no exception. Here are two pictures of the visiting kids. When I planned to visit Mount Vernon, I also decided that I would drive up the coast of California, Oregon and Washington while enjoying another extraordinary road trip. All in all, I spent 3 weeks driving up and down the West Coast. The first part of the trip was a straight shot from Carlsbad to San Jos√© in the Bay Area where I stayed with my friends Tony and Kim for the weekend. From there, I headed north to the Golden Gate Bridge and once I crossed it, I veered West to the Pacific Coast Highway. I followed PCH along the northern California coast for 300 miles until it merged with Highway 101. It is fantastic road that in many places hugs the cliffs. Sadly, there are very few places to stop and admire the landscape. Michele has a lovely home in Mount Veron with a backyard that includes a chicken coop. Her chickens are quite smart and very healthy looking. Michele was a great host. She took me sightseeing around Puget Sound. It was a wonderful opportunity to catch up. Michele and I spotted a bald eagle near the town of Anacortes. Click on it to see it in full size. One of my first stops was the little town of Bolinas in the Southern edge of Point Reyes National Seashore. Bolinas is like a hippie preserve which is trying to stave off development and maintain its isolation. I also got to see Mt. Thielson, one of the steepest peaks in the Cascade range. I also visited Mount Shasta and hiked on its slopes for a short while. Unfortunately, it was cloudy and the summit was not visible. By the time I returned home I had travelled 3200 miles in two weeks and had enjoyed an incredible experience. I visited some magnificent places and also connected with several old friends along the way. Sunset was North of Point Arena in California. The day ended in the town of Garberville south of the Avenue of the Giants. The next day, I traversed the Avenue of the Giants in the Humboldt Redwoods State Park. The forest contains the tallest trees in the world Sequoia Sempervirens. There is an enormous amount of vegetable matter, decaying leaves, moss, fallen trees that holds lots of moisture. The result is that the forest is an incredibly quiet place full of shade and moisture. You follow the old highway 101 now Avenue of the Giants for tens of miles catching glimpses of the sun between the trees and stopping from time to time to hike between the enormous tree trunks. Sunset found me twenty miles north of Eureka in Clam Beach County Park, California. The next morning I woke up in Brookings, Oregon to a sunny day. I spent the day driving up the southern half of the Oregon coast. It is a beautiful place full of scenic viewpoints, rugged beaches, light houses and hiking trails. Whaleshead Rock, Oregon Arch Rock State Beach, Oregon Clam Beach County Park, California. You can only find the coastal redwoods in Northern California. By the time the you reach the border with Oregon, the vegetation has changed. Further north, the road passes the town of Eureka. There are two distinctive victorian mansions there. The Pinc Lady Mansion (not a typo). This is now a hotel. The Carson mansion. It was built for William Carson, one of the original lumber barons of California. Now, it is a private club. That evening, I reached Newport, Oregon on Yaquina Bay. The next morning I visited the town and took some pictures of the Yaquina Bay Bridge. Haystack Rock in Cannon Beach, Oregon Driving was less fun that morning because it started raining and also because in the northern half of the Oregon coast the road veers inland for very long stretches. I got a break from the rain at sunset when I reached Cannon Beach. I got to see Haystack Rock in a beautiful sunset light. By the time I reached my destination for the day, the town of Astoria, Oregon, at the edge of the Columbia River, the rain had picked up again. The next morning, I drove to the top of the hill where the Astoria Column is located. From the top of the column you get a great view of the town and the 4 mile Astoria Bridge that spans the Columbia River. The Astoria column is decorated with paintings illustrating events of the history of the region. It is fun to climb it. The view of the town of Astoria, Oregon and the wide Columbia river. That morning, I crossed the bridge into Washington State, and kept on driving on Highway 101 until I reached the town of Olympia, Washington and from there I drove to Seattle and Mount Vernon. The next few days I spent with several friends and I also drove to Vancouver, Canada one afternoon Finally, it was time to head South and return to San Diego. I drove back following the inland route. The most outstanding sight I saw was Crater Lake National Park. This is the deepest lake in the country. Vancouver Harbor, British Columbia. Crater Lake, Oregon. Mount Thielson, Oregon. In December, I visited both the San Diego Zoo and the Safari Park. I wanted to have chance to practice taking pictures of the animals using my long lens. This will come in handy next year. Here are some of the pictures I liked the best.
