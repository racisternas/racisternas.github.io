There were trips and adventures, of course, also reunions with old friends, but most important, there was a major life transition: I retired after 42 years of writing software for a living. But before I get ahead of myself, let me tell you the story of 2023 in order. 2023 was a very rainy year in Southern California so much so that it rained every month until June and then we even had a rare Pacific Coast hurricane in August. All that rain caused the draught to end and kept the hills green throughout the entire Summer which is very rare in these parts. Beyond Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park begins. Since the period of mourning for the Queen was still going, there were tens of thousands of flower offerings all over Hyde Park, St. James Park and other locations. The outpouring of grief was massive. Walking through London, you get to see all the major landmarks: the Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, the London Eye, and Nelsons Column at Trafalgar Square. The British Museum has such a gigantic collection of wonderful artifacts that a one-day visit guarantees hours and hours of walking down its halls with no hope of seeing it all. Still, the extent of the collection is overpowering. From left to right, the Rosetta Stone, cat mummies from ancient Egypt, and a Persian Astrolabe used for navigation from 1235 A.D. After the British Museum, a stroll through Covent Garden and dinner. The London Eye at night. A panorama of Picadilly Circus at night. The White Tower, in the Tower of London complex. Started by William the Conqueror in the 11th century. The London Bridge Two views from the London Eye I spent the whole week walking around in London. When I tallied my steps, I had walked more than 40 miles and taken hundreds of pictures. But everything comes to an end and I took the \"tube\" to Heathrow and then flew to Amsterdam. The main attraction in Amsterdam is the city itself, built over water by driving wooden piles into the bottom of a pond and then creating platforms where they could build houses. They left canals between the platforms so that people and goods could move The city is currently being rebuilt from the ground up. After more than three centuries, a large number of the wooden piles need to be replaced. The other two major attractions in Amsterdam (if you are not counting the red light district) are the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum. The Van Gogh was completely booked so that took care of the decision of what to visit. The museum is best known for its unequaled collection of Flemish Masters but it also has a very beautiful collection of South and East Asian art in the lower level. This oil painting is enormous (more than 22 feet long) and is entitled \" Militia Company of District VIII under the Command of Captain Roelof Bicker Bartholomeus van der Helst. The title is long too. This is an Indian bronze statue from the 12th century depicting Shiva Nataranja the Lord of Dance. Sometime in the 1600s, Petronela Oortman, the widow of a very wealthy merchant in Amsterdam, decided that she wanted the most fanciful doll house ever built. Since she was incredibly wealthy, she got her wish. These are just two of the rooms of the dollhouse which is entirely built with the finest materials. The plates in the shelves are made out of real painted blue porcelain from Delft. That goes to prove that when rich people have too much money they will resort to buy extravagant stuff to show off how wealthy they are. In this case the result of the extravagance is an imposing and beautiful piece of art. At least the trophy is not a social network. After a long weekend in Amsterdam, I flew to Berlin. I have family in Berlin from my mothers side. My second cousin Brigitte has a daughter called Simone who, in turn, also has a daughter called Karolin. Karolin is thus my second cousin twice removed. She recently gave birth to a baby son called Fintan. Karolin and Fintan look lovely in this picture. Above, there is a picture of Brigitte (Karolins grandmother) and my other cousin Bettina (she is also my second cousin) who happens to be first cousin of Brigitte. If that sounds too complicated just focus on the important stuff, they are all lovely and welcoming people. I had not been to Berlin in seven years and I was happy to see them all. I had been to Berlin a couple of times before. The first time the Berlin Wall was still standing. In my opinion, Berlin encompasses a large part of the history of the 20th century and most of it is still there ready to be visited and observed. Probably the most iconic building in Berlin is the Reichstag or parliament building. It was built towards the end of the German empire and saw the rise of the Weimar republic, the collapse of democracy and rise of fascism. It was severly damaged during the invasion and Soviet ocupation, it was a testament to the partition of Germany (the Berlin Wall ran just a few meters from it), and ultimately became the new parliament after the fall of the East German regime and reunification. To symbolize this new state of affairs, the Reichstag was rebuilt. The roof in the middle of the building was replaced by a skylight that brought in sunshine as a symbol of political transparency in the new reunified Germany. Above the skylight, the architect Norman Foster built an enormous glass dome that contains a structure of mirrors that directs sunlight to the parliamentary chamber below. It is a marvel and it can be openly visited. The dome has a double spiral ramp that takes visitors all the way to the top and back down again. Berlin does not have skyscrapers so the view from the dome is unobstructed. The Victory Column (Siegess√§ule) that commemorates the triumph during the Franco-Prussian war. The reliefs in the base have gaps because they were stolen by the French army during the WWII occupation. They were returned by the French government in the 1990s as a good will gesture minus the missing parts which were lost. The Gate of Ishtar from the ancient city of Babilon. This magnificent gate and many other trasures can be found in the Pergamon Museum, one of five museums in the Museum Island in Berlin. Click on the picture above for more images of treasures of the Pergamon. The New Synagogue of Berlin Chocolate reproductions of the Brandenburg Gate and the Victory Column at Rauschs chocolate shop. This place is a mandatory stop for chocolate lovers. It also has a cafe upstairs. The week in Berlin went by very fast and soon it was Saturday and I took a cab to Brandenburg Airport. That was the start of a 30-hour journey to my home taking three separate flights. I arrived to San Diego without a problem and I went to sleep after the long trip. The next day was Sunday and besides unpacking and shopping for food everything went by normally. On Monday I had a normal workday. Since I work remotely from home, there was no issue. On Tuesday, the third day after my trip, I woke up and I knew immediately that something was not right. I could barely get out of bed and I had a fever. An antigen test confirmed my suspicions, I had Covid. So, the moral of the story is that all that excitement about leaving Covid behind was just overconfidence and misplaced optimism. I spent a week in bed but it was pretty mild all in all. The rest of the year went by quickly. I did a series of trips to the Anza Borrego State Park and did some off-road driving in the harder to reach parts of the park. Palm Oasis The Wind Caves on the South East end of Anza Borrego. View of the Badlands in Anza Borrego State Park from Fonts Point. Winter sunsets in the desert are usually spectacular. View from the end of Smugglers Canyon. The trail ends in a sudden drop-off, a dry waterfall. Detail of the Quadriga atop the Brandenburg Gate. It was found and brought back to Berlin when the Prusians occupied Paris after Napoleons defeat. The Brandenburg Gate. It has seen a lot of history. Napoleon marched with his troops under it and promptly stole the Quadriga and took it to France. Another metal sculpture in Borrego Springs. This one is called Brecedas Vineyard. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... . 2022 promised to deliver us back to our pre-pandemic lives but instead it broke our hearts. We had Putin invading Ukraine, the economy suffering, and multiple problems in many parts of the world. But we also saw stories of courage, and passion, and creativity. People helping complete strangers, astounding new forms of AI-assisted art being created, new and exciting medical treatments being developed. We saw the JWST send us back the most beautiful images from the end of the universe and the beginning of time. It is an exciting time to be alive! I wish a much better New Year to all of you, with adventure, surprises, happiness, and full of creative possibilities. I hope for a year where your life is fulfilling and you get to enjoy the company of those you love. Have a great 2023! (and drop me a line when you can) In January , after an early storm, I drove to Palm Springs and tried to take the tram up Mount San Jacinto to see the snow fall. Of course, there were 10,000 other people who had the same idea so there were no tickets left. I ended up visiting the Palm Springs Air Museum. They have an excellent collection of airplanes from World War II and later. Also in January, I paid a visit to the Sunset Cliffs sea caves in San Diego. This part of the coast South of Ocean Beach is beautiful but can only be visited when the low tide is negative which only happens a few times every year. Then the water is low enough to enter the caves. This time, the low tide coincided with a sunny day caused by the Santa Ana winds. The bright light and the colors made for a beautiful outing. In February, I gave the San Jacinto tram another shot. This time, I got to ride the tram up the mountain and enjoy the winter landscape. The view from the top of the tram. The large fields of wind turbines are visible at below on the desert floor. View of the San Jacinto mountains in the late afternoon. View of Palm Springs in the moonlight. I took my small drone to Mount San Jacinto and flew it above the trees. Looking at the mountain from above gives you a whole new perspective","tags":"","url":"index.html","UUID":"BF39CDCB8C9D4D26890E62290C41D747"},{"title":"PalmSpringsNightimeView","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"palmspringsnightimeview.html","UUID":"BFB8494FCA9C4202BAA73E5A525E170C"},{"title":"TopOfTheTram","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"topofthetram.html","UUID":"4F4716C0F2F04556B1E461B51AF374ED"}]};
