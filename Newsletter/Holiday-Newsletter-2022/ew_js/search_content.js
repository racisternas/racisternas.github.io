Here we are with the pandemic in the rear view mirror and all of us moving on with our lives and... what did you say? A new wave of Covid-19 is upon us? We have been vaccinated and boosted and still, the virus seems to always find a clever way to get back at us. Case in point: After 5 Covid shots and an easing of health restrictions for travellers, I flew on a bunch of airliners to get back home from Europe and, you guessed it, I got Covid. Sure, after all the vaccinations, it was a relatively mild case that left me sleeping 16 hour days for a week but still, are we ever getting our lives back???!!! Short answer: no, the bug is staying here joining other yearly scourges such as the common cold and Influenza. In other words, it has come to make us miserable until it decides to mutate to greener pastures. As every year, I want to share some of the pictures I capture to tell the story of my year, This time, there is a new feature. A lot of the pictures can be seen in full screen if you click on them. You will see which pictures to click on when your cursor changes. I also have a couple of vides, also a first. I am crossing my fingers that it all works. A beautiful Aeonium in bloom in my neighbor's front yard. Winter was relatively mild with flowers blooming through January and February. We are blessed to have fantastic weather in San Diego with plenty of sunshine and blooming flowers year around. Perhaps our main problem with weather is how we go through cycles with little to almost no rain. A Fortnight Lily from my front yard. Rock rose (Cistus) The main event of the winter was the installation of solar panels on my roof by Sunrun in February. I finally was wooed to go solar and sign a lease for 20 years. It turned out to be a good idea because inflation has gone up quite a bit in 2022 and the monthly installment price is already better than the bill from the electric company would have been. woo-hoo! With travel restrictions being lifted, I planned a trip back to Chile to visit my Mom. This would be the first time I could visit Chile since 2019. There would be a lot of friends and family to visit after all this time away. Now, a long trip requires some prepping. Some things to prepare for are well known like getting all my vitamins and supplements organized while I am away from home. Other things were new as in completing all the online forms needed by the chilean government plus getting a PCR test less than 48 hours before departure. By and by, I crossed all the items from my to-do list and I began packing. In February, I visited the Safary Park again. I really enjoy the cool days in the park when the tourists are gone and there are no lines. A mallard with iridescent plumage This cheetah posed for me for a long time This is the last picture I ever took of Izu the lion. He died in 2022 just a couple of months later at the ripe old age of 18 years. He had come to the Safari Park as a cub and I had seen him there many times. He lived a long life as the head of his pride. Ah, but packing to go to Chile requires some special skills. Since my Mom loves Amazon, she orders what she needs and has it delivered to my doorstep without hesitation. When all was said and done and the Amazon boxes stopped arriving (\"it is just a few more items left to be delivered\" I would read in Whatsapp messages), and I removed all the packing material I was left with a small mountain of items which left precious little space for my own clothing. \"Don't worry, the weather is very mild at the beginning of April.\" my mother messaged. They say that a thousand mile journey begins with a single step. In my case, it was an Uber car that came to pick me up from home and deliver me to the airport in San Diego. From there a flight to Dallas and a quick connection to Santiago de Chile. Santiago's airport had been under construction for more than four years but it had finally been fully replaced by the time I arrived in March 2022. The new airport is massive and it requires lots of walking from the arrival gates to immigration, the Covid health check station, the PCR testing center, the baggage claim, and the agricultural checkpoint where trained dogs sniff you not for weapons or explosives but for any traces of fruits or vegetables. Entering the country with unprocessed food items is forbidden and you can get a hefty fine if you refuse to dispose of it. My cousins Magdalena and Rodrigo graciously picked me up from the airport where we had a light breakfast and then we drove to the city where I got to see my Mom. After that, I checked-in to a spiffy little AirBnB where I would stay for two weeks. For the last three years, Santiago has had some of the strictest health care measures in Latin America so much so that in March 2022 people were still required to wear a face mask everywhere, including while walking down the street. That was surprising to me because Chile also had one of the highest rates of Covid vaccinations in the world. The Ministry of Health also required a \"mobilty pass\" that needed to be shown at the entrance to every gathering place like a restaurant to prove vaccination status. However, after two years of the Covid pandemic, the restaurants in Santiago were all packed with people eager to get on with their lives. One of the people I had come to visit in Santiago was my old friend Hector Daniel Diaz. We met in middle school so he and I have known each other for more than four decades. Hector suffered a massive stroke at the end of 2021 but he pulled through after a long stay in the hospital. We were both happy to meet after more than two years. I had the pleasure of being invited to dinner by my cousin Andrés and hs wife Loreto. My cousin Magdalena took me on a visit to Viña Santa Rita, a traditional central valley vineyard where we visited the Museo Andino (a museum with priceless pre-columbian art) and also had lunch. I met with Jaime Plaza, a friend since kindergarten, at Sky Costanera, the tallest building in South America, to take pictures of Santiago from above and to enjoy the view. Jaime is a professional photographer who now lives in Sydney, Australia. We had a lot of fun watching the sun go down over Santiago and observing the skies grow dark and the lights of Santiago begin to light up all the while taking pictures. I visited the little dead-end street where I grew up in the neighboorhood of Ñuñoa. And I also visited my friend Loreto Jiménez whom I have also known since kindergarten and who was working at her second job: an itinerant handcrafts store with gifts from many countries. And last but not least, I visited my great friend from college Alejandro Yachán who lives near Viña del Mar, close to the ocean. Below is the view from the restaurant window where we had lunch. This is the view of the eastern portion of Santiago with Manquehue hill at center left and the Andes in the background. Travelling to Chile always means renewing contacts with my friends and family. It is a way to stay in touch and to refresh old memories. All vacations come to an end and soon I headed back to San Diego where Spring had already begun. During the month of April, my friend Tony came to Carlsbad and together we travelled to Borrego Springs and stopped at Galleta Meadows to admire the metal sculptures. In May, Fiona, John and I went to see Neil Gaiman live at the Balboa Thater in San Diego. It was an evening of stories, fantasy, and Q&A. Also in May roses are in bloom and the beaches are full of activity. A jacaranda bloom from my tree. In June, my friend José Quiroga, a tireless human rights advocate and a pioneer in the treatment of victims of torture, celebrated his 90th birthday with his family and a large contingent of friends. It was a great and very enjoyable event. I am looking forward to his 100th birthday. A beautiful oak tree that sits at the top of the hill behind my neighborhood. July arrived and I decided to give myself a birthday present. I bought a DJI mini 3 pro drone. Drone technology has advanced in leaps and bounds. Nowadays, a good drone is no longer too expensive and the quality of the videos plus the ease of flying it makes it super fun to own. I quickly put it to work making videos in the nearby lagooons. Dahlias from my neighbor's front yard. The drone can also take still pictures and can stitch multiple shots automatically as in the case of the panorama above taken directly over my house. If you click through on the picture, you can see the lagoon in the far distance and the ocean beyond. The video above is a hyperlapse of the San Elijo lagoon. You can play it full screen. July also means barbecues. Planting tomatoes... And more trips to the beach August brought along the tourists to Carlsbad. It also brought my cousin Jaime who stayed with me for a couple of days after attending a conference in San Diego. Jaime teaches physics at the Universidad San Sebastián in Santiago.","tags":"","url":"index.html","UUID":"7AA1B648B9B14135A1544307F73A672A"},{"title":"Las_Condes","text":" ","tags":"","url":"las_condes.html","UUID":"8C5B50DB96464D208C0EEB4BF5C01B1C"},{"title":"Pelicans","text":" ","tags":"","url":"pelicans.html","UUID":"C5DFDFA9B20D47C5B02534CED5B131F1"},{"title":"Surfer","text":" ","tags":"","url":"surfer.html","UUID":"453C841DE02C4F989D1CC1CF479B7A69"},{"title":"Seagull","text":" ","tags":"","url":"seagull.html","UUID":"D7DE889DD6C94B1A9A8A3FB3C840B0BC"},{"title":"Mallard","text":" ","tags":"","url":"mallard.html","UUID":"8C996B02320F4DD29D44A54492D8FB3E"},{"title":"Cheetah","text":" ","tags":"","url":"cheetah.html","UUID":"AAF8904EC2A54A5DA4342B4D684D64B7"},{"title":"Izu_Lion","text":" ","tags":"","url":"izu_lion.html","UUID":"E2BCE1104508470CAD5C39F5C54F70EC"},{"title":"test_page","text":" ","tags":"","url":"test_page.html","UUID":"58C3695DCDCE4965AC89FF914FC03CF5"},{"title":"Mallard","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"mallard.html","UUID":"62FA13446A494426AEFB26AFF4DA15D5"},{"title":"Las_Condes","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"las_condes.html","UUID":"3488949E46374A5EA00BA39D8F9125F5"},{"title":"Mallard 2","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"mallard-2.html","UUID":"6AFCC33AFA3B4FCF921C37DB35A1A75B"},{"title":"Izu_Lion","text":" Izu the Lion","tags":"","url":"izu_lion.html","UUID":"0870F84AB264464E9D4E6E8A1E90F1F3"},{"title":"Cheetah","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"cheetah.html","UUID":"B4C33B7819274A3DB80AF2A28C33B460"},{"title":"Seagull","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"seagull.html","UUID":"0D6A8D39E06D42719DC13EB0412EBBF9"},{"title":"Surfer","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"surfer.html","UUID":"400E65B4FD2C4DF68F2D1151DF040896"},{"title":"PelicanFlock","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"pelicanflock.html","UUID":"42F89B0B83F54854A738F778BE536248"},{"title":"Rose","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"rose.html","UUID":"C000BB7C155F4260B079979ED2D59D94"},{"title":"Jacaranda Bloom","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"jacaranda-bloom.html","UUID":"F9D1826CAD014115873BE2A83CDDBA73"},{"title":"OakTree","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"oaktree.html","UUID":"0502AAAC8AD046EC8E561DBA4C31535D"},{"title":"Dahlia","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"dahlia.html","UUID":"5A1AE5EEB9F14AD69D6C7A0A679E70D8"},{"title":"CanterburyPanoramaSunset","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"canterburypanoramasunset.html","UUID":"B6B187F6750E4A2BB7735A0ECEA8D0B2"},{"title":"JulySunset","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"julysunset.html","UUID":"F01AB96AEC2D460FBECDB0D018CBADB2"},{"title":"Aeonium","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"aeonium.html","UUID":"523FECFB66BC48648AA57E5CC93F156C"},{"title":"FortnightLily","text":" &nbsp","tags":"","url":"fortnightlily.html","UUID":"785B89BB4D744E55B9EE5B625FB0D3D4"}]};
