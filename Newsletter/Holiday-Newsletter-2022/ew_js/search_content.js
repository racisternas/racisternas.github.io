Here we are with the pandemic in the rear view mirror and all of us moving on with our lives and... what did you say? A new wave of Covid-19 is upon us? We have been vaccinated and boosted and still, the virus seems to always find a clever way to get back at us. Case in point: After 5 Covid shots and an easing of health restrictions for travellers, I flew on a bunch of airliners to get back home from Europe and, you guessed it, I got Covid. Sure, after all the vaccinations, it was a relatively mild case that left me sleeping 16 hour days for a week but still, are we ever getting our lives back???!!! Short answer: no, the bug is staying here joining other yearly scourges such as the common cold and Influenza. In other words, it has come to make us miserable until it decides to mutate to greener pastures. As every year, I want to share some of the pictures I capture to tell the story of my year, This time, there is a new feature. A lot of the pictures can be seen in full screen if you click on them. You will see which pictures to click on when your cursor changes. I also have a couple of vides, also a first. I am crossing my fingers that it all works. A beautiful Aeonium in bloom in my neighbor's front yard. Winter was relatively mild with flowers blooming through January and February. We are blessed to have fantastic weather in San Diego with plenty of sunshine and blooming flowers year around. Perhaps our main problem with weather is how we go through cycles with little to almost no rain. A Fortnight Lily from my front yard. Rock rose (Cistus) The main event of the winter was the installation of solar panels on my roof by Sunrun in February. I finally was wooed to go solar and sign a lease for 20 years. It turned out to be a good idea because inflation has gone up quite a bit in 2022 and the monthly installment price is already better than the bill from the electric company would have been. woo-hoo! With travel restrictions being lifted, I planned a trip back to Chile to visit my Mom. This would be the first time I could visit Chile since 2019. There would be a lot of friends and family to visit after all this time away. Now, a long trip requires some prepping. Some things to prepare for are well known like getting all my vitamins and supplements organized while I am away from home. Other things were new as in completing all the online forms needed by the chilean government plus getting a PCR test less than 48 hours before departure. By and by, I crossed all the items from my to-do list and I began packing. In February, I visited the Safary Park again. I really enjoy the cool days in the park when the tourists are gone and there are no lines. A mallard with iridescent plumage This cheetah posed for me for a long time This is the last picture I ever took of Izu the lion. He died in 2022 just a couple of months later at the ripe old age of 18 years. He had come to the Safari Park as a cub and I had seen him there many times. He lived a long life as the head of his pride. Ah, but packing to go to Chile requires some special skills. Since my Mom loves Amazon, she orders what she needs and has it delivered to my doorstep without hesitation. When all was said and done and the Amazon boxes stopped arriving (\"it is just a few more items left to be delivered\" I would read in Whatsapp messages), and I removed all the packing material I was left with a small mountain of items which left precious little space for my own clothing. \"Don't worry, the weather is very mild at the beginning of April.\" my mother messaged. They say that a thousand mile journey begins with a single step. In my case, it was an Uber car that came to pick me up from home and deliver me to the airport in San Diego. From there a flight to Dallas and a quick connection to Santiago de Chile. Santiago's airport had been under construction for more than four years but it had finally been fully replaced by the time I arrived in March 2022. The new airport is massive and it requires lots of walking from the arrival gates to immigration, the Covid health check station, the PCR testing center, the baggage claim, and the agricultural checkpoint where trained dogs sniff you not for weapons or explosives but for any traces of fruits or vegetables. Entering the country with unprocessed food items is forbidden and you can get a hefty fine if you refuse to dispose of it. My cousins Magdalena and Rodrigo graciously picked me up from the airport where we had a light breakfast and then we drove to the city where I got to see my Mom. After that, I checked-in to a spiffy little AirBnB where I would stay for two weeks. For the last three years, Santiago has had some of the strictest health care measures in Latin America so much so that in March 2022 people were still required to wear a face mask everywhere, including while walking down the street. That was surprising to me because Chile also had one of the highest rates of Covid vaccinations in the world. The Ministry of Health also required a \"mobilty pass\" that needed to be shown at the entrance to every gathering place like a restaurant to prove vaccination status. However, after two years of the Covid pandemic, the restaurants in Santiago were all packed with people eager to get on with their lives. One of the people I had come to visit in Santiago was my old friend Hector Daniel Diaz. We met in middle school so he and I have known each other for more than four decades. Hector suffered a massive stroke at the end of 2021 but he pulled through after a long stay in the hospital. We were both happy to meet after more than two years. I had the pleasure of being invited to dinner by my cousin Andrés and hs wife Loreto. My cousin Magdalena took me on a visit to Viña Santa Rita, a traditional central valley vineyard where we visited the Museo Andino (a museum with priceless pre-columbian art) and also had lunch. I met with Jaime Plaza, a friend since kindergarten, at Sky Costanera, the tallest building in South America, to take pictures of Santiago from above and to enjoy the view. Jaime is a professional photographer who now lives in Sydney, Australia. We had a lot of fun watching the sun go down over Santiago and observing the skies grow dark and the lights of Santiago begin to light up all the while taking pictures. I visited the little dead-end street where I grew up in the neighboorhood of Ñuñoa. And I also visited my friend Loreto Jiménez whom I have also known since kindergarten and who was working at her second job: an itinerant handcrafts store with gifts from many countries. And last but not least, I visited my great friend from college Alejandro Yachán who lives near Viña del Mar, close to the ocean. Below is the view from the restaurant window where we had lunch. This is the view of the eastern portion of Santiago with Manquehue hill at center left and the Andes in the background. Travelling to Chile always means renewing contacts with my friends and family. It is a way to stay in touch and to refresh old memories. All vacations come to an end and soon I headed back to San Diego where Spring had already begun. During the month of April, my friend Tony came to Carlsbad and together we travelled to Borrego Springs and stopped at Galleta Meadows to admire the metal sculptures. In May, Fiona, John and I went to see Neil Gaiman live at the Balboa Thater in San Diego. It was an evening of stories, fantasy, and Q&A. Also in May roses are in bloom and the beaches are full of activity. A jacaranda bloom from my tree. In June, my friend José Quiroga, a tireless human rights advocate and a pioneer in the treatment of victims of torture, celebrated his 90th birthday with his family and a large contingent of friends. It was a great and very enjoyable event. I am looking forward to his 100th birthday. A beautiful oak tree that sits at the top of the hill behind my neighborhood. July arrived and I decided to give myself a birthday present. I bought a DJI mini 3 pro drone. Drone technology has advanced in leaps and bounds. Nowadays, a good drone is no longer too expensive and the quality of the videos plus the ease of flying it makes it super fun to own. I quickly put it to work making videos in the nearby lagooons. Dahlias from my neighbor's front yard. The drone can also take still pictures and can stitch multiple shots automatically as in the case of the panorama above taken directly over my house. If you click through on the picture, you can see the lagoon in the far distance and the ocean beyond. The video above is a hyperlapse of the San Elijo lagoon. You can play it full screen. July also means barbecues. Planting tomatoes... And more trips to the beach August brought along the tourists to Carlsbad. It also brought my cousin Jaime who stayed with me for a couple of days after attending a conference in San Diego. Jaime teaches physics at the Universidad de Los Andes in Santiago. I ran into these folks at the beach. The pretty girl is Ambellina and her Dad is my friend Breland. Breland can be seen here introducing his infant daughter to high fructose corn syrup sodas from an early age. Have I mentioned that he is a pediatric nurse? In September, I got a case of wonderlust and decided to travel to Europe. Unlike six months earlier during my trip to Chile, by early Fall we had defeated the virus and health care precautions were no longer necessary. No face masks were required in any airports or flights and no one bothered to check the vaccination cards. We were all ready to climb on a plane and fly to far-off lands while singing kumbaya. So, off I went to Europe. My first stop was London where I arrived the day before the Queen's funeral. After a very very short connection in Dallas I had managed to run from one terminal to another and get on my transatlantic flight but my suitcase did not ran as fast as I did. So, faced with a London in mourning with very few business open, I decided to wait at the airport for the next flight which would bring my suitcase. I patiently waited for many hours in Heathrow's terminal 3 in the company of some tired and abandoned luggage and a lonely hockey stick. Once I got my suitcase, I proceeded to take the subway to London. My first stop was Liverpool station where I took a train to Norwich. That is where my cousin Magdalena's son and daughter-in-law live and where she was visiting. So I went all the way to Norwich to have dinner with the relatives. The next day, we all watched the funeral and the procession in the telly, and then I took the train to London. Kensington Palace is the home of the Prince of Wales and is at the western end of Kensington Gardens. The picture on the right shows the Albert Memorial and the Royal Albert Hall as seen from the Gardens. Beyond Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park begins. Since the period of mourning for the Queen was still going, there were tens of thousands of flower offerings all over Hyde Park, St. James Park and other locations. The outpouring of grief was massive. Walking through London, you get to see all the major landmarks: the Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, the London Eye, and Nelson's Column at Trafalgar Square. The British Museum has such a gigantic collection of wonderful artifacts that a one-day visit guarantees hours and hours of walking down its halls with no hope of seeing it all. Still, the extent of the collection is overpowering. From left to right, the Rosetta Stone, cat mummies from ancient Egypt, and an Persian Astrolabe used for navigation from 1235 A.D. After the British Museum, a stroll through Covent Garden and dinner. The London Eye at night. A panorama of Picadilly Circus at night. The White Tower, in the Tower of London complex. Started by William the Conqueror in the 11th century. The London Bridge Two views from the London Eye I spent the whole week walking around in London. When I tallied my steps, I had walked more than 40 miles and taken hundreds of pictures. But everything comes to an end and I took the \"tube\" to Heathrow and then flew to Amsterdam. The main attraction in Amsterdam is the city itself, built over water by driving woden piles into the bottom of a pond and then creating platforms where they could build houses. Leaving canals between the platforms so that people and good could move The city is currently being rebuilt from the ground up. After more than three centuries, a large number of the wooden piles need to be replaced. The other two major attractions in Amsterdam (if you are not counting the red light district) are the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum. The Van Gogh was completely booked so that took care of the decision of what to visit. The museum is best known for its unequaled collection of Flemish Masters but it also has a very beautiful collection of South and East Asian art in the lower level. This oil painting is enormous (more than 22 feet long and is entitled \" Militia Company of District VIII under the Command of Captain Roelof Bicker Bartholomeus van der Helst. The title is long too. This is an Indian bronze statue from the 12th century depicting Shiva Nataranja the Lord of Dance. Sometime in the 1600s, Petronela Oortman, the wife of a very wealthy merchant in Holland, decided that she wanted the most fanciful doll house ever built. Since they were incredibly wealthy, she got her wish. These are just two of the rooms of the dollhouse which is entirely built with the finest materials. The plates in the shelves are made out of real painted blue porcelain from Delft. That goes to prove that when rich people have too much money they will resort to buy extravagant stuff to show how wealthy they are. In this case the result of the extravagance is an imposing and beautiful piece of art. At least the trophy is not a social network. After a long weekend in Amsterdam, I flew to Berlin. I have family in Berlin from my mother side. My second cousin Brigitte has a daughter called Simone who, in turn, also has a daughter called Karolin. Karolin is thus my second cousin twice removed. She recently gave birth to a baby son called Fintan. Karolin and Fintan look lovely in this picture. Above, there is a picture of Brigitte (Karolin's grandmother) and my other cousin Bettina (she is also my second cousin) who happens to be first cousin of Brigitte. If that sounds too complicated just focus on the important stuff, they are all lovely and welcoming people. I had not been to Berlin in seven years and I was happy to see them all. I had been to Berlin a couple of times before. The first time the Berlin Wall was still standing. In my opinion, Berlin encompasses a large part of the history of the 20th century and most of it is still there ready to be visited and observed. Probably the most iconic building in Berlin is the Reichstag or parliament building. It was built towards the end of the German empire and saw the rise of the Weimar republic, the collapse of democracy and rise of fascism, it was severly damaged during the invasion and Soviet ocupation, it was a testament to the partition of Germany (the Berlin Wall ran just a few meters from it), and ultimately became the new parliament after the fall of the East German regime and reunification. To simbolize this new state of affairs, the Reichstag was rebuilt. The roof in the middle of the building was replaced by a skylight that brough in sunshine as symbol of political transparency in the new reunified germany. Above the skylight, the architect Norman Foster built an enormous glass dome taht conbtains a structure of mirrors that direct sunlight to the parliamentary chamber below. It is a marvel and it can be openlu visited. The dome has a double spiral ramp that takes visitors all the way to the top and back down again. Berlin does not have skyscrapers so the view from the dome is unobstructed. The Victory Column (Siegessäule) that commemorates the triumph during the Franco-Prussian war. The reliefs in the base have gaps because they were stolen by the French army during the WWII occupation. They were returned by the French government in the 1990s as a good will gesture minus the missing parts which were lost. The Gate of Ishtar from the ancient city of Babilon. This magnificent gate and many other trasures can be found in the Pergamon Museum, one of five museums in the Museum Island in Berlin. Click on the picture above for more images of treasures of the Pergamon. The New Synagogue of Berlin Chocolate reproductions of the Brandenburg Gate and the Victory Column at Rausch's chocolate shop. This place is a mandatory stop for chocolate lovers. It also has a cafe upstairs. The week in Berlin went by very fast and soon it was Saturday and I took a cab to Brandenburg Airport. That was the start of a 30-hour journey to my home taking three separate flights. I arrived to San Diego without a problem and I went to sleep after the long trip. The next day was Sunday and besides unpacking and shopping for food everything went by normally. On Monday I had a normal workday. Since I work remotely from home, there was no issue. On Tuesday, the third day after my trip, I woke up and I knew that something was not right. I could barely get out of bed and I had a fever. An antigen test confirmed my suspicions, I had Covid. So, the moral of the story is that all that excitement about leaving Covid behind was just overconfidence and misplaced optimism. I spent a week in bed but it was pretty mild all in all. The rest of the year went by quickly. I did a series of trips to the Anza Borrego State Park and did some off road driving in the harder to reach parts of the park. Palm Oasis The Wind Caves on the South East end of Anza Borrego. View of the Badlands in Anza Borrego State Park from Fonts Point. Winter sunsets in the desert are usually spectacular. View from the end of Smugglers Canyon. The trail ends in a sudden drop-off, a dry waterfall. Detail of the Quadriga atop the Brandenburg Gate. It was found and brought back to Berlin when the Prusians occupied Paris after Napoleon's defeat. The Brandenburg Gate. It has seen a lot of history. Napoleon marched with his troops under it and promptly stole the Quadriga and took it to France. Another metal sculpture in Borrego Springs. This one is called Breceda's Vineyard.","tags":"","url":"index.html","UUID":"7AA1B648B9B14135A1544307F73A672A"},{"title":"Las_Condes","text":"
