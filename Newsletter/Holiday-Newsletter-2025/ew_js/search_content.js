You will see your cursor change for those pictures. I guess you could say we all have had quite the year. 2025 has been a return to chaos and the chaos has been relentless. There is a constant barrage of bewildering or embarrasing news which beg the question: how did I land in this timeline? The year began with alarming news: my 89 year old mother was diagnosed with a serious disease so if you see a lot of pictures from Chile on this page, it is because I flew there a lot of times during 2025. Now, at the end of the year, I can tell you that she is still around (now 90 years old) but 12 months ago, that outcome was not entirely clear. In January, I joined a group of San Diego photographers on a visit of Sonny Bono National Wildlife Refuge on the SaltonSea. The Salton Sea is the largest artificial lake in California and a nesting place for migratory birds escaping the Canadian cold. Among them, Canadian Snow Geese are frequent visitors to inland California during the much warmer winter season. Burrowing Owl. Canadian Snow Geese flock taking off at sunrise. Burrowing Owl. Male Quayle. Black winged stilts at sunset. In February, I flew to Chile to be with my Mom during her radiation therapy. February is the height of Summer vacation in Chile which means the city is quite deserted and all chances of social connection are postponed until March.That is a bit of an exaggeration but not by much. I spent several afternoons at the MUT (Mercado Urbano de Tobalaba) a newish shopping and dining center with lots of food choices and a direct connection to the subway. Definitely, the most exciting thing happening in Santiago right now and a step above the traditional shopping malls. I somehow managed to meet with a few old friends over coffee at the MUT. Most of them were getting ready to flee the city for the coast or points farther away. Now, that is what we call iced coffee in Chile. Real icecream! The MUT seen at night from my rental appartment. I also visited the San Diego Zoo. I had a photographic tour coming up in April 2025 and I needed to practice shooting animals. The San Diego Zoo is within Balboa Park, the crown jewel of San Diego. After the zoo closed for the day, there was still some time for great shots of the Balboa Park buildings and gardens during blue hour. The original buildings of El Prado date from the days of the Panama-California Exhibition in 1915 organized to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal. The original buildings were just facades (like Potemkin villages) built for the ehibition but proved so popular that they were rebuilt as solid buildings in 1935. At the end of February I was back home when my neighbor Jess came by to introduce her beautiful baby girl Stevie. She looks like a doll and what can be more awwww-inducing than a cute baby picture? During March, I stayed in Carlsbad while getting ready for my next adventure. March marks the beggining of Spring in Southern California and among the blooming flowers and the trips to the beach in nicer weather to enjoy the sunset light, I also managed to view the lunar eclipse. African Pygmy Goose American Flamingo. View of El Prado in Balboa Park, San Diego. The lunar eclipse or Blood Moon as seen from my street. Great Egret in flight Commuter train at sunset. I also visited the San Elijo lagoon in March. The egrets were still nesting in the lagoon. The light during March was already much brighter than at the start of the year which made the sunset shots more striking. Finally, April rolled around and the next big adventure got underway. I had signed up for a 10 day photographic tour of Patagonia in April at the end of 2024. The trip would start and end in Buenos Aires and would cover parts of Chile and Argentina. Our first stop was the town of El Calafate in Argentina and from there, we rode a bus to Torres del Paine National Park in Chile. The park is world class. It encompasses rivers, lakes and glaciers plus the mountains which have given the park world wide reknown. Besides the extraordinarily beautiful landscapes, there are lots of wild animals which thrive within the park. I was extremely lucky to see Condors, Guanacos, Pumas, Ñandues and Cara-caras among other animals. It is a land where nature runs wild and untamed. The whole of Patagonia is known for its wildly variable weather. You could have sunshine in the morning and get drenched a couple of hours later. We were lucky to enjoy sunny days almost every day during our stay which made our pre-dawn photo shoots a lot more pleasant. Guanaco jumping a fence. Torres del Paine at dawn. Female Andean Condor. Cuernos del Paine at dawn. Male Andean Condor. A female Puma with her two cubs. Beautiful light in the Patagonian mountains. Moonrise above the Cuernos del Paine.

Notice how the clouds condense over the chilly peaks. Cuernos del Paine reflected on Lake Pehoe. Kestrel. Seracs (column of glacial ice) in Grey Glacier. Grey Glacier. Cara cara. After 5 days in Torres del Paine N.P., we drove back into Argentina and visited Lago Argentino. Our first stop was Glaciar Perito Moreno. It is an enormous glacier, the largest in the region, and is fed by the gigantic Southern Icefields that lie across the Andes mountains. Perito Moreno Glacier. Over 17 miles long from its source to glacier front. Perito Moreno Glacier seen from the surface of Argentino Lake. Close up of a Guanaco. Fall foliage in Rio de las Vueltas. A male Shoveler Duck. Pre-dawn view of Mount Fitz-Roy with light trails from cars. We also visited the town of El Chalten which has a magnificent view of Mount Fitz-Roy. After Patagonia, I spent two days in Buenos Aires courtesy of a massive workers strike that affected all airlines. Buenos Aires is a great metropolis. Long past its days of splendor in the middle of the last century, it is still attractive because of its graceful buildings and beautiful parks. I walked around the northern part of the city in the neighborhoods of Palermo and Recoleta. A giant T-Rex about to devour a high rise? No, just a statue in Parque Palermo. A professional dog walker in a residential neighborhood of Buenos Aires. The Recoleta Cemetery is the place where all the high profile Argentinians of the past are buried. One of the most important mausoleums contains the tomb of Eva Perón, the first wife of Juan Domingo Perón twice president of Argentina. Evita, as she was known by her many admirers, worked tiredlessly for the poor and disposseded during her husband's presidency until she passed away from cancer. She was elevated to the status of a national icon by the masses and to this day, more than 70 years after her death, her tomb is the most popular destination in the Recoleta Cemetery After another visit to Santiago to check on my Mom, I returned home to Carlsbad. May and June, I spent in San Diego. I went to the beach, visited the Carlsbad Rose Garden, traveled to the Anza-Borrego desert a couple of times, and went to Balboa Park during school graduation time. Agave blades. Ocotillo. View of badlands from Fonts Point. Moonrise over Anza-Borrego badlands. Leopard shark caught and released by a fisherman. Rose in bloom at the Carlsbad Rose Garden. Boy playing in the waves. Balboa Park is the stage of many photo shoots. In this case a girl is posing for a portrait around graduation day. These girls were dressed for the rehearsal of their ballet class recital. This is the contrail created by a SpaceX rocket booster after launching from Vandenber AFB. The rocket passed over our airspace on its way to orbit. The contrail has been twisted by the high altitude winds. July brought my cousin Jaime to my home. Jaime teaches physics in Universidad de Los Andes and he often comes to San Diego during the Summer to present papers at a conference. Together, we visited the Mount Palomar observatory which was used more than 80 years ago by Edwin Hubble to gather the images that helped him discover that we are in one galaxy among many and that the universe is expanding. The 200 inch Hale telescope dome in Mount Palomar. Jaime in the town of Julian where he tried Julian Apple Pie. Later in July, I traveled to Santiago once again. Among other things, I took care of processing my retirement pension since I had just turned 65. Like all things bureaucratic, the process became more coplicated than necessary when I discovered that my chilean ID card had never been activated by the people at the chilean consulate in Los Angeles. Without an official chilean ID card, you basically do not exist for all legal purposes. That prompted a series of events that landed me in the Foreign Affairs ministry in downtown Santiago where I went begging for a solution. The amazing thing is that my card was activated and I managed to start my pension all in the same day. The bureaucracy gods smiled upon me. While downtown, I walked around a bit and took some pictures. La Moneda presidential palace. The chilean Stock Exchange. In August I went to Europe. I decided to visit Lyon in France but when I looked at the map, I realized that Lyon is very close to Geneva and also Chamonix so I decided to start in Switzwerland and work my way to France. The famous Jet d'eau in Lake Geneva as seen at night during a lightning storm. Geneva's Old Town is highly walkable and is full of historic landmarks. Place du Molard in Geneva. The cobblestones of the square were refreshed 10 years ago and some of them were replaced with acrylic squares that have lights underneath creating a beautiful visual effect at night. The famous Reformation Wall monument in Geneva's Parc des Bastions showing the leaders of the Calvinist reformation. A whimsical sign for a tea house in Geneva's Old Town. From Geneva, I took a day trip to Chamonix. The alpine village of Chamonix is a center for alpine sports year around. When I arrived there, early in the morning, there were para gliders and climbers already at work. My objective in Chamonix was to climb the two trams and elevator that take you to the top of Auguille du Midi, a granite needle that reaches 3800 meters of elevation. From its lookout point, there is a magnificent view of the Mont Blanc, the tallest mountain in Europe. Lake Geneva illuminated by a lighning storm. The Auguille du Midi's summit as seen from the observation deck of the tram's upper station. If you look carefully, you will see the glass box where one steps to have a picture taken with the Mont Blanc in the background. The Mont Blanc, tallest mountain in Europe. The infamous glass box known as Step into the Void. with the Mont Blanc in the background. You need to remove your shoes and wear slippers to step on the glass so they can avoid scratches. If the glass were to crack there is open air for 1000 meters underneath. From Chamonix we boarded a small alpine train that climbed the tracks to the Mar de Glace or sea of ice, the largest glacier in France. Every spring, the company that runs the attraction drills a tunnel in the glacier's ice. The Mar de Glace glacier coming down the northern side of the mont Blanc massif. Walking through the ice tunnel is a beautiful experience. The light reflected from the ice imbues everything with a gorgeous bluish hue. Back in Geneva, I spent another night visiting the Old Town. The next day, I took the train to Lyon in France. Lyon is the second largest city in France and has been occupied since Roman times. Lyon is known as the culinary center of France. It is also the proud home of a tradition of silk weaving that goes back several centuries and that was supercharged by Joseph Marie Jaquard in 1804 with his invention of the programmable loom. The Lyon Cathedral. During Reformation, hordes of protestants threw stones at the figures on the frontis of the building destroying all the statues of saints. The pedestrian bridge that crosses the Saône river. In the background is the Palace of Justice. The Théâtre des Célestins. The Weight of Oneself. The character depicted is holding himself. Monument to the Resistance during WWII. The Basilica. The hill of Croix Russe, the traditional home of the silk weaving shops in Lyon and a bastion of workers rights movements. Lyon is a beautiful city with clearly defined sectors that follow the architecture of the century in which they were built. The center portion is a peninsula called Presqu'ile (almost an island). The building style is similar to Parisian buildings which is very nice but without Parisians which is even nicer. After Lyon, I rented a car and drove South to Provence. There are too many beautiful things to see in Provence so I will just includes pictures of one of the most magnificent structures here: the Pont du Gard. It is an aqueduct built by the Romans 2,000 years ago to provide water to the city of Nimes. It was still working in the 1700s. Pont du Garde, a 2000 year old Roman aqueduct over the river Garde. The river Garde. September was meant to be a month of rest after all the travels. I had neglected to service my car and visit doctors for checkups so all of those types of activities were waiting until September. Also, the water in the ocean was still pleasant and so I visited the beach several times that month until... disaster struck in mid-September. To be more precise, a Sting Ray stung me while swimming at the beach. I had read that a Sting Ray venom injection is one of the most painful experiences of that kind. I can confirm that now. I was evacuated from the beach by the lifeguard truck and taken home by my daughter. Fortunately, very hot water causes the venom to break down and the pain to ease very quickly. Unfortunately, the wound looked clean intially so the first doctor I saw told me to keep the skin clean and let it heal without giving me any medicine. Bad choice. I developed a serious infection and in spite of returning to see the doctors twice and taking a bunch of antibiotics, my foot kept swelling and getting worse. I was given an ultimatum, if the oral antibiotics don't make the infection and swelling improve in 48 hours, go to the hospital immediatetly. In the end, I checked in to the local hospital where I spent three nights being pumped into my veins with antibiotics. Fun fact: the infusion pump they used was a Plum, a pump I personally worked on almost 20 years ago at Hospira (since acquired by other health instrumentation companies). I was discharged from the hospital with even more antibiotics to take by mouth. My main concern at that point was that I had less than two weeks to get ready for my trip to Japan in October. I was not sure I would be able to fly to Japan in the condition I was and not sure if 12 days was enough time to get stronger. I was concerned about the onset of deep vein thrombosis considering all the swelling I still had. Fortunately, I did heal enough to fly to Japan, which I did in October. In October, I visited Japan for the first time in my life. I was invited by my friend Alberto Ruiz to join him in a trip to Japan. Alberto and I know each other since we worked together at 24 Hour Fitness. The interesting thing is that although we chat frequently, Alberto and I had never met in person because he works remotely from Mexico. So Japan would be the first time we would meet in the flesh. We had been working on our itinerary and all the attractions we would visit since July so by the time we landed, we had a very clear plan to follow. Since we flew into Tokyo, we would visit that city first. I planned to arrive a few days before Alberto because I wanted the extra time to get over the jet lag and to take a night time photography tour in Tokyo. Alberto Ruiz, my travel partner, in Odaiba, Tokyo. About to land in Narita Airport, Tokyo. There are nonstop flights from San Diego to Tokyo that are reasonably priced! I could probably fill a couple of web pages talking about all the sites I visited in Tokyo and posting hundreds of pictures. There is no point in doing that because if you plan to visit Tokyo, a fascinating city of 30 million people, you will undoubtedly find things to amuse, charm, entertain or educate you regardless of your personal interests. Tokyo is a world unto itself. The main thing to keep in mind is that Tokyo is a city that works. It has fantastic public transportation, great parks, beautiful temples, clean public toilets everywhere, more restaurants than any other city in the world, insignificant levels of street crime and dozens of fun activities. You will be safe, well fed and entertained in your visit and you will get everywhere on time. What else can you ask for? The bleeding wound was not, by far, the most painful thing. The Stingray venom was. A bucket list item of mine was to visit the Ghibli studio museum. Studio Ghibli is the pre-eminent Japanese animation studio. The museum is a super fun place but they do not allow pictures to be taken indoors. Here, I am posing with a guardian robot from the movie Castle in the Sky on the rooftop gardens. The Golden Gai is an area of Shinjuku with several alleys full of little bars. It is popular with the locals and the tourists. This is the pagoda of the Senso-ji, the oldest Buddhist temple in Japan (1400 years). It was rebuilt after WWII. There is a pair of giant rope sandals attached to the wall of the entrance gate to the Senso-ji. Each sandal weights half a ton. It represent the giant deities that protect the temple. During weekends and holidays, entire families visit the temple wearing traditional kimonos like this little girl bowing in front of the Senso-ji temple. This is the Hozomon Gate, the main gate of the Senso-ji temple. It is always packed with people from morning to night. This is the view from the top of the Shibuya Sky, an observation point above Shibuya's shopping district Next to the Shibuya train station, is the famous Shibuya Scramble crossing. When the traffic lights change to favor pedestrians, hundreds of people cross in all directions. It is quite popular on Instagram. A statue of Kannon or Boddhisatva of Compassion in Buddhist teachings. A stone carving of a pair of Warabe Jizō or guardian of children. The Kanda Myoujin Shrine near Akihabara is open for prayers at all times of day or night. A little bar in an alley in Shinjuku. The warm lighting creates a sense of intimacy. A train from the Shinjuku line rushes over a bridge past the bright city lights carrying commuters home. One of the pleasures of Tokyo is to walk in the streets at night. The assembly of lights and colors makes every block in commercial areas stand out. The Ginza district at night is breathtaking. All the luxury stores compete for attention with the most exciting light designs on their facades. The Imperial Gardens have a large pond with Koi fish. The Shinkansen or bullet train going past the Ginza train station. Kiyomizu-dera shrine. After Tokyo, the next stop in the trip was Kyoto. Kyoto was the capital of imperial Japan for several hundred years until the Shogunate ended and emperor Meiji decided to move the capital to Tokyo to consolidate power. However, Kyoto has the most abundant collection of shrines and temples because of its long history as a seat of power. It is impossible to visit them all during a short visit and to see as many temples as possible, it is best to walk through the city. Senbon Torii or the Thousand Torii Gates. Fushimi inari taisha shrine. Girls posing at the entrance to the Kiyomizu-dera shrine. The Golden Pavillion. The Tokyo International Forum (convention center). Tokyo has a large number of beautiful parks like the Shinjuku Gyoen National Gardens. Women posing in traditional kimonos by the side of the river. The hills around the city of Kyoto are covered with bamboo forests. The Ryōzen Kannon temple. Cemetery on the eastern hills of Kyoto above Senbon Torii. Nijō Castle Gate (Shogun Castle). Nijō Castle (Shogun Castle). The following pictures are from the Moss Temple gardens or Kokedera. There are about 120 different types of moss in the gardens. Osaka was the next stop of the trip. Osaka is a large city that was a seat of power for the Shogun. As such, it has a large castle originally built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a warlord who unified Japan in 1590. Osaka Castle. The moat around Osaka Castle. The view from the top floor of Osaka Castle. Another interesting attraction in Osaka is the Dotonbori canal district which is full of stores and restaurants and is a magnet for visitors. Directly North of the Dotonbori is Midosuyi Boulevard a beautiful avenue with luxury stores. Midosuyi Boulevard crossing. A family strolling in Midosuyi Boulevard. The HIPS building in Namba. The final stop of my trip to Japan was the city of Hiroshima. Obviously, Hiroshima has become synonymous with nuclear devastation during war but the the city is beautiful and has a lot of attractions for the visitors. The main thing that sets Hiroshima apart is its layout. Since it was built on a river delta, it is criss-crossed by a number of rivers so it is made up of little islands connected by bridges. It is also full of parks and avenues lined with gardens. The most recognizable building in Hiroshima is the Atomic Dome which largely survived the nuclear blast. A scale model of the city prior to the atomic explosion. In this picture I am ringing the Peace Bell in the Peace Memorial Park. The Goddess of Peace statute honors the hundreds of school children killed by the atomic blast. The Memorial Tower to Mobilized Students. Close to Hiroshima is Miyajima Island. The island has beautiful hills covered in forests, monuments, shrines and the famous Floating Torii Gate. It can be reached from Hiroshima via a train ride and a ferry boat. The island is also home to wild Sika Deer which approach the tourists begging for food. Floating Torii Gate. Sika Deer. During November I stayed in San Diego. I had a lot of catching up to do plus Wiggles missed me since I had been gone so often. I bought a very special long lens for my Sony camera in November which I intend to use next year in some future adventures. To test it, I visited Moonlight beach and took pictures of the surfers. Double Crested Cormorant. I also took pictures of the animals at the Safari Park. Bald Eagle. Male Gorilla. Sand Cat. Sumatran Tiger. My final conclusion was that the new lens is superb and hopefully, this time next year I will be able to share some interesting pictures of wildlife. During December I visited Chile again to check on my mother. I did have an interesting outing to the Andes mountains during my visit. I hired a tour that took me to Embalse El Yeso. It is a reservoir in the mountains above Santiago which I had not visited since I was a child. I was happy to notice that the waters of the reservoir are still the same turquoise color I remembered as a kid. The tour went past the reservoir into a private ranch all the way to the El Plomo Hot Springs. It was a great experience. El Yeso Reservoir. El Yeso Valley. I also took a walk around downtow Santiago. Reflection of the Santiago Cathedral on a high-rise glass wall. Bridge in the Paris-London neighborhood. Monument to originary peoples. After visiting Chile, I had come to the end of my travels for 2025 and had reached the end of the year. The holidays are here and it is time again to get this newsletter out to you. Each year, the tale is told using my pictures but each year the task becomes more gargantuan. 10,000? 15,000? 20,000 pictures taken during the year? How many pictures can I conceivably fit on a web page? And so a lot of choices have to be made for better or worse to come up with the smallest set of images that can tell my story in 2025. The pictures are not an accident, they are a reflection of what I was doing at a point in time and also a testament to what catches my eye. Photography is just an extension of the photographer's eye. Next year I expect to do more of the same. I have some adventures planned out and others that are yet to be planned but my main goal continues to be to explore the world and capture images that satisfy my vision. If you enjoy them too, that is a welcome outcome. Whether we stayed in touch in 2025 or not, you have been in my mind at some point through the year. I hope you are all doing well and that the we can reconnect in the New Year. I wish a great 2026 to all of you, with adventures, surprises, happiness, and full of creative possibilities. I hope for a year where your life is fulfilling and you get to enjoy the company of those you love. Have a great 2026! (and drop me a line when you can) Here I am sitting in the beautiful reading room of the National Library. Northern Carmine Bee Eater.
