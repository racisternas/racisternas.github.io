We made it through another year of the pandemic but in spite of that, 2021 seemed even tougher than the first one. By the end of 2020, we all had expected some sort of post-vaccination gradual return to normalcy where we would steadily regain all the things we previously gave up because of COVID-19. No such luck. Our hopes were answered by a confusing cycle of improvement followed by waves of new viral strains. In spite of all that, we kept doing some of the things we enjoy. In my case, that translates into traveling while taking pictures of the places I visit. At the beginning of 2021, I decided to work on improving my photo technique trying to focus on the things that better represent the emotional impact of a place or a subject. Happy Holidays! Thinking that I needed some high quality glass to get better pictures, I decided to drop some serious coin on a long zoom lens from Sony. I patiently waited for the lens to arrive in the mail and then, as luck would have it, the Safari Park in Escondido reopened the same week I received my new lens. With the condition of having to wear a face mask at all times, I was allowed to visit the animals and make some pictures with my new lens. Almost all the animals, that is. The gorillas were in quarantaine because of a COVID outbreak in their ranks. We have a lot in common with our hairy cousins, enough to make them also a target of Corona virus. The year began with brief winter storms followed by clear skies which produced dramatic sunsets, a staple of San Diego county beaches during the colder months. The picture above was taken in Carlsbad State Beach right after the New Year's. The Oceanside Pier with a January winter storm approaching. I finished a series of pictures there just as the rain began to fall. Hyacinth Macaw The view from the lookout point over Borrego Springs on the Montezuma Valley Road at sunset. During March, I visited Moonlight Beach in Encinitas. It was the weekend and there was a guy making giant soap bubbles for the children to play. The kids would chase a bubble and jump inside before it burst. It was a lot of fun to watch. There was a father teaching his toddler son how to surf. The kid was only four years old and had already picked up the basic moves. April brought the promise of freedom. After so much isolation during the early part of the pandemic, I finally got the chance to get the vaccine. Fiona scored two vaccination appointments for me in April and even if it meant driving to Temecula it was still worth it. Hey, the line was not long, I barely felt the shot and I hardly had any side effects. What is there not to like? Getting both shots in April meant that I would be fully immunized in May... With the arrival of Spring, my mango tree began to seriously bloom for the first time in a decade. In the picture above you can see the little round fruit beginning to grow. Also, Spring and its warmer days brought out all the lizards in my garden. Travelling in mid-May meant that the North rim of the Grand Canyon would just be open so my first destination became Kanab Utah, a small town near the Arizona border less than a two hour drive from the North rim. After visiting the South Rim a few times, I had always wanted to see the opposite side of the Grand Canyon. The North rim village is a good hour from the entrance to the park and getting to the canyon means traversing a long and heavily wooded section of the Kaibab Plateau. Add to this that the North Rim is only open part of the year, has far fewer facilities than the South Rim, is more densely wooded, and is also less crowded, the experience of visiting the North Rim is quite different and more beautiful than the South Rim. The picture on the right shows the Bright Angel creek created by the Bright Angel fault. Far in the distance is the main canyon and the cliffs of the South Rim. In fact, the distance is so large, that you can only see the buildings across the canyon with good binoculars. Bright Angel Canyon is the northern portion of the Bright Angel trail that crosses the Colorado river and joins both rims of the Grand Canyon. The view from the restaurant is spectacular. That is Angel's Window and in the distance you can see the San Francisco mountains which are close to Flagstaff. I finished my visit to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon by watching the sunset at Cape Royal with a bunch of equally awed people. The next day, I drove north from Kanab to the western terminus of scenic Highway 12 which I followed eastward for the next couple of days. Highway 12 cuts across the Pink Cliffs which you can see in the distance in the picture on the right. That is the same strata of pink rock that you will find in Bryce Canyon and it constitutes the top-most \"step\" in the Grand Staircase. It is very difficult to describe the layout of this region because it is so exceedingly vast and the names of the landmarks are just names until you actually see them in person. Imagine what it is like to have multiple layers of sandstone formed by the minerals deposited by a large inland sea over many millions of years. Each succesive age changed the flow of the sea and its mineral composition so that the rocks that formed have different colors and properties but each succesive age is very distinct and recognizable. Now, you can imagine a layer cake made up of multiple layers of sandstone rocks extending for hundreds of miles. The rocks through time are subject to faulting and erosion so gradually the cross section of the cake is exposed. The remarkable thing about the Grand Staircase is that the individual properties of each layer of rock have determined how it becomes exposed by the elements. The end result is a series of fairly even cliffs and \"steps\" (plateaus) spanning dozens and dozens of miles where each layer constitutes a distinct \"step\" in the staircase from the Chocolate cliffs at the bottom all the way to the Pink cliffs at the top. There is a place about 10 miles south of the Grand Staircase called Lefevre Overlook where you can see all the steps in the Grand Staircase in the distance (as explained in the diagram above). It is probably the only way to appreciate how big this region truly is. Lefevre Overlook is located on the edge of the Kaibab Plateau that you climb on your way to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. The view from Lefevre Overlook is below. It does not begin to do it justice because the scale is so vast. The Pink Cliffs at the top are over 40 miles away. Just a few steps east of Yovimpa point at more than 9000 feet of elevation is Rainbow Point. It is a lookout with a commanding view of the basin below of Bryce Canyon and the mountais beyond. Below is the view from Rainbow point looking east. At the far end of the picture is the promontory known as Powell point and on the left is the Aquarius Plateau, the highest point in the geography of southern Utah (over 11,000 feet). Just a few miles further down the road is the turn off for Bryce Canyon National Park. Bryce Canyon is on a very long mesa (about 10 miles long) that runs north to south and ends in a panoramic viewpoint called Yovimpa Point. from that point of view you can see as far south as the Kaibab Plateau and as far east as Navajo Mountain more than 50 miles away in a straight line. You can see the faint contour of Navajo Mountain on the far left of the picture below and Kaibab Plateau is a light bluish grey layer on the far right of the image. Dead center is the small peak known as \"Molly's nipple\". Back on Highway 12, if you hang a right on Cannonville and drive another 5 miles down Kodachrome Road, you will soon be in Kodachrome Basin State Park. This place was first surveyed by some cartographers from the National Geographic Society which gave it the name because they thought it was very colorful. It contains miles and miles of hiking trails that are flanked by spires, cliffs, caves and other rock formations. Kodachrome Basin is more low key than Bryce Canyon but that quietness makes it very pleasant to visit. The lower elevation compared to Bryce gives it a warmer weather and different vegetation. After visiting Kodachrome Basin, I drove on Highway 12 to Escalante for dinner and then to Boulder where I arrived after nightfall. I was very lucky to find a room on short notice in a beautiful lodge where I spent the next two nights. The lodge is in a farm in a small valley and unlike so many other places in the area, it has plenty of water and greenery. 2021 was not a fun year. We all hoped for a return to our normal pre-pandemic lives but one thing after another kept getting in the way back to normalcy. At times, it seemed like we were our own worst enemies putting our petty selfish needs ahead of the simple things that would help us get the upper hand on the fight against the pandemic. Throughout the entire year people kept dying or getting seriously ill. Long COVID became a reality to hundreds of thousands of people affecting their lives for years to come. That is a very sobering thought. We can only hope that as it has been the case in previous events of this type, like the flu pandemic in 1918 for example, COVID will evolve into less deadly strains and it will recede into the background becoming more and more the stuff of memory. In my own personal life, I long to be able to go back to Chile and visit family and friends without having to worry about cancelled flights and forced quarantaine periods. Hopefully, that time is near. The end of the year has signified through many thousands of years a re-energizing renewal of nature. It is a pivot in time when the days begin to get longer and we see the darkness being pushed away, little by little, every day. I hope your lives are joyful and fulfilling in this new year. I also hope you have the chance to realize your personal projects and enjoy the company of those you love. Have a great 2022! (and drop me a line when you can) In the low desert the Cholla cactus is common and can be found in large clusters. This is a tighter look at Powell point and the gathering storm clouds at sunset. Far in the distance between the clouds, you can see the silhouette of the Henry mountains. Egyptian vulture This duck is not a Safari Park permanent resident. It is just one of the many birds that choose to spend some time in the park's lagoon during a stop in their migration. The light on the water looked beautiful. The African elephants were happily playing in their enclosure. A waterbuck catching some January sunshine. A Great Egret Lesser Flamingo I was very excited to visit the Safari Park in January. This was the first time since the start of the COVID pandemic that I had visited a major public place in a year and it felt like a small step towards normal life. In February, I decided to visit the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. I wanted to leave the larger San Diego metropolitan area for the first time this year. I also wanted to check out the scenic slot canyon known as \"The Slot\" (I know, not a very inventive name) which is carved in the desert floor. \"The Slot\" meanders its way slicing into the desert floor for about a mile, creating steep cliff walls and becoming ever narrower until you need to squeeze between the rocks to continue hiking. The high point of the hike happens about a third of a mile down the trail where a pilar of stone has detached from the canyon wall but its collapse has been stopped by the opposite wall of the canyon. It really looks like it could come down crashing any minute precisely while your are hiking underneath it. It is truly a fun hike. The valley floor around Borrego Springs is also famous because of the more than 130 metal sculptures created by Ricardo Breceda. The sculptures represent various animals, some are real and some others are fantasy but all are quite stunning. They are located in various places around the valley floor so it is better to drive around until you find a group of sculptures and then walk around to examine them at closer range. The Sea Serpent is by far the largest sculpture in the valley. That same month, I went to Joshua Tree National Park, the only National Park in Southern California. Joshua Tree takes its name from the eponymous giant Yucca plant that lives in the high desert of California. The park encompases parts of the Mojave (or high) Desert and the Sonora (or low) Desert plus a transition zone in between. That is why the Joshua trees are only present in the north part of the park. Joshua Tree NP is also famous for its rock structures that are a magnet to rock climbers. As soon as the middle of May came around, now fully immunized, I loaded my car and headed to Utah. The red rock desert of the Colorado Plateau is one of my favorite destinations. This would be my 7th trip there and even though I have visited all the major destinations, the Colorado Plateau is so vast that there is always something new to see. This is the view from Point Imperial looking towards the east. The Colorado bends it course near the eastern park boundary where it flows north-south instead of east to west. On the far side lies the Painted Desert, part of the Navajo Nation. The ridge on the far right is the eastern end of the Coconino plateau which encompasses the region north of Williams, AZ all the way to the South Rim's edge. After that Geological digression, I can continue where I left off: I was driving east on Highwway 12. A few miles down the road, Highway 12 traverses Red Canyon State Park a little state park that includes red rock cliffs and spires. Perhaps the most recognizable feature is the rock arch created during the highway construction. What people come to see in Bryce Canyon is all the hoodoos and spyres of red rock. On the left below is me standing in front of sunrise point, a huge semi circle of red rock cliffs. On the right, and below is the approach and descent into Wall Street, a trail that meanders down a steep canyon with vertical rock walls. I got some rest at the lodge and then the next day, I went back on Highway 12 where I retraced my steps from the night before which I had not seen during the night. The road between Boulder and Escalante was built between 1935 and 1940 by the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) an organization created by the government during the Great Depression. It is not a long distance but it cuts across an almost insurmountable barrier of rocks. The picture on the right shows the ribbon of asphalt which is Highway 12, cutting into the maze of rocks. The place where I took the picture is called the \"head of the rocks\" and has a nice lookout point. Far in the distance, the Henry mountains. The Henry mountains are so remote that they were the last mountain range to be mapped in the United States. Later that day, I had lunch in Escalante (which incidentaly is not populated by a mob of murderous robots in cowboy attire), and then drove to the start of Hole in the Rock road. This deserves a little explanation. Years ago, I read a history book about the settling of this area by the mormons during the late 19th century. The Latter Day Saints church was very interested in having their brethren settle as much of Utah as they could before the gentiles (non-mormons) pushed into the region. The construction of the transcontinental railroad added urgency to this enterprise. So in 1879 a group of 250 settlers answered the call of the church elders and set out to in 83 horse-drawn wagons from Parowan (along what is now I-15), all the way to the frontier town of Escalante. From there, they would blaze a trail that would parallel fifty-mile mountain (the uninterrupted straight cliffs that border the east side of the Kaiparowitz plateau). Their plan was to follow the direction of the cliffs until they met the waters of the Colorado River, cross to the other side, and continue eastward until the place of their new settlement. They figured that a month an a half would be plenty of time to traverse the region. The end of the cliffs foretells the proximity to the river. Beyond, Navajo Mountain is visible across the Colorado river. The modern road follows the original mormon trail paralleling the cliffs. As the road progresses, the land drops slowly in altitude which makes the cliffs rise higher from the bottom of the valley. After 40 miles and several weeks of travelling while blazing their own trail, the caravan reached a spring which they promptly called 40-mile spring. Nearby a large rock with a flat surface became the impromptu stage for communal dances. The rock, called Dance Hall rock is in the picture below. The cliffs, visible on the right hand side, continue on for many more miles. While waiting by the spring, the group got news from their scouts that there was a solid wall of rock blocking access to the Colorado. Undeterred, the group decided to continue on with the hope of finding a place to cross the Colorado river. At the end of the trail a wall of rock blocked all access to the river except for one place where a fault in the rock revealed a steep canyon that descended to the river. The mormons widened the crack in the rock (the Hole in the Rock as it is known) with dynamite and built a ramp using logs that allowed all of their wagons and cattle to descend unharmed. It took them six weeks to complete their own road through the rock but they finaly made it across the river, up the other side, and ultimately continued east until they found suitable land where they founded the town of Bluff. The Hole in the Rock road became a trading route for several years afterwards and a ferry was created at this point to cross the Colorado. The story sounded so extraordinary that after I read it, I decided that one day I would follow that same road all the way to the Colorado river (nowadays the river is flooded by Glen Canyon) to see for myself what these 19th century people had managed to do. The path through the rocks that the mormon pioneers created was barely wide enough to allow the passage of a single horse-drawn wagon at a time and very steep; up to a 45-degree grade in places. The trail is nearly impassable now because of more recent rock slides but you get a great view of Glenn Canyon below. If you feel adventurous and wish to travel the Hole in the Road road, please make sure to use a high clearance four wheel drive vehicle. Cars break down regularly in that road and it becomes rougher the farther you get into it. Ultimately, if you break an axle 50 miles in, you won't be able to call AAA for a tow because there is no cell phone reception anywhere. Fortunately, there is a small but steady contingent of visitors who may give you a lift back to Escalante if you needed it. An additional warning, the land where the first part of the road is belongs to the Bureau of Land Management which allows private cattle grazing everywhere. I was aware of that fact since I had a face-off with a longhorn a day earlier east of Kodachrome Basin. However, as I exited the Hole in the Rock road after nightfall, I almost drove straight into a black cow which was standing in the middle of the road. A close encounter with 1000 pounds of steak is enough to get your heart pounding. The 50-mile-mountain near Escalante. You will notice that as the land drops, more of the cliffs are exposed and they grow taller. Hole in the Rock road is not just about the story of the Mormon Pioneers. There are multiple other sights along the way: slot canyons, rock arches, parts of the Escalante river, they are all accessible through a network of Bureau of Land Management roads that criss cross the land every few miles. Just remember, all the roads are unpaved and some are fairly rough. On the way in, I stopped at Devil's Garden, a small state park that encompasses a large group of hoodoos as you can see below. The rocks have multiple layers which causes the lopsided shapes of the hoodoos since the top-most layer is harder and less erosion-prone. This is Metate Arch. At the end of April, Fiona turned 23. Unlike in 2020 when all the restaurants were closed during lockdown, this time we had dinned at a great restaurant. John gave Fiona a new cat as a birthday gift. Her name is Millie. The following day, I drove down the Burr Trail Road. Although not as rough as the Hole In the Rock road, the Burr Trail road traverses a big stretch of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Starting in Boulder, the road heads east down a couple of canyons until it enters the area known as the Circle Cliffs. From there it continues east and south entering Capitol Reef National Park and crossing the Waterpocket fold in the Burr Trail switchbacks (picture on the right). Capitol Reef is a wall of stone nearly 80 miles long formed by a monocline ( a single fold in the earth's crust). It can only be crossed in a few places and this is one of them. It is also known as the waterpocket fold because there are natural pools of water that form in the rock. These pools of water store rainfall for many months of the year and were used by the mormon pioneers. Before descending the switchbacks, I took a side road called the Upper Muley Twist Canyon trail. It is a very narrow and rough 4x4 road that makes the Burr Trail look like a 4 lane highway. It is only 3 miles long but at the end of the road, there is a short trail that takes you to the Strike Valley Overlook. This point allows you to appreciate dozens of miles of the back side of the anticline in Capitol Reef. The view is magnificent. It allows you to appreciate the angle of the tilt of the crust and how the erosion formed a long valley below. Behind all that are the Henry Mountains (I keep getting closer to them). This is Peek-a-boo arch, one of several rock arches in the Upper Muley Twist Canyon trail The rest of the afternoon I followed the Burr Trail road South and East until I exited the national park. Then I stopped in Halls Creek overlook which provides another incredible sight of the Capitol Reef monocline. Later I drove to the Bullfrog Marina in Glenn Canyon National Recreation Area and had dinner there. You can see how much the water has receeded during the long drought because the paved ramp no longer reaches the water level. Those are house boats floating in the water. The next day, I visited the main district of Capitol Reef National Park. Out of the \"Big 5\" national parks in Utah, Capitol Reef is the one that is hardest to reach so it gets less visitors. However, a lot has changed since my last visit 15 years earlier. A lot of new hotels have been built and the tourists are far more numerous. Like with most National Parks, it only takes a a little hiking to find isolated spots in the park. The picture below shows a sharp bend on the trail known as the \"Grand Wash\", one of the few places that cross the Capitol Reef rock monocline. Mormons settled here as well building the little village of Fruita in the 1880s and working the land. The settlers' families were served by a one room school which is still standing. Their orchards are still bearing fruit all these years later. You can see a testimony of their presence in this land in the Capitol Wash. Generations of settlers starting in the 1880s carved their names on the rock walls. My next stop in my trip was Moab. When I first visited this town in Utah about 15 years ago the general mood was a lot more quiet. Nowadays, with the lure of the Colorado River, two major National Parks and a state park nearby plus all the hiking, off-roading, rafting, and mountain biking you can dream of, the town is bustling all the time. There are a lot of new hotels in place and a few more are being built. The Colorado river flows directly north of Moab. It comes out of a rock canyon, makes a slow turn while watering the land of the fertile Spanish Valley and then disappears into another rock canyon. That ease of access to the river is something you do not find elsewhere in this land. The only exception being the town of Page in Arizona. After Page there is no easy access to the waters of the Colorado river for hundreds of miles downstream, way after the water has flowed past the Grand Canyon. That is what makes Moab such a touristy place. The Colorado River on its way to the confluence with the Green River. Grand View point in the Island in the Sky district of Canyonlands NP. Below the White Rim, hidden by the multiple layers of rock, the Colorado River flows. The confluence with the Green River lies just a few miles ahead and is also hidden. Far away in the distance, the Abajo mountains. The small dirt roads that can be seen on the White Rim below were built during the uranium mining boom after World War II and before Stuart Udall helped secure this land as a National Park in 1964. Mesa Arch framing the rock spires of Canyonlands and the La Sal mountains with their snowy peaks at sunset. After visiting Canyonlands NP and a few other trails, it was time to drive back home. 750 miles back to Carlsbad in a single and very long day. I got home in time to stop at Trader Joe's to buy milk and other supplies before they closed. All in all, a very exciting and beautiful trip. The rest of the Spring season passed rather quickly. The yellow lilys bloomed like in past years, I took some pictures of the backyard \"wildlife\", and began visiting the beach regularly. Sadly, in early July, my long time friend Squiggles the corn snake died at 13 years of age. You may think of a snake as just a nuisance but as a pet, a snake is a beautiful animal that makes very minor demands. Unlike domestic animals, the snake is always true to its nature. Squiggles was a quiet and colorful presence in my house for many years. She had been Fiona's pet originally so she came to give Squiggles a burial in the backyard. A close-up of Squiggs from earlier this year. She was pretty lively until the day she passed. Pretty quickly I realized that I missed the snake. I would enter the room and look at the empty terrarium and realized that it was not the same without her. I wanted to get a new corn snake but the world of corn snakes is fairly complex. There are dozens of \"morphs\" (mutations) with various colors and patterns so it took a while to find the \"right\" snake. It turns out that you can buy snakes on the web and they will ship them overnight to you. That is how Wiggles, barely one month old, came to my homefrom Florida: in a little plastic carrier brought by FedEx. She is a beautiful female corn snake with a slightly different coloration than Squiggles. So far, shee seems content with her lodgings and enjoys her meals thoroughly. The rest of the Summer and early Fall passed very quickly. It was all a blur of flowers blooming, mangoes finally ripening, more trips to the beach, and of course work. I took another trip to the Anza Borrego desert in the early fall. I got to enjoy the magnificent panorama of the badlands from Fonts point. But the main goal of this trip to Anza-Borrego was to try my hand at shooting pictures of the Milky Way which I did from Blair's valley, a dark-sky area south of the town of Borrego Springs. I hope to do more of this photography in 2022 More stunning sunsets as San Diego enjoys during the Fall. A great jazz concert Fiona, John and I attented in the Observatory in North Park where we listened to Snarky Puppy. And always be sure to have plenty of great coffee available. One final adventure at the end of the Fall of 2021. I visited the sea caves in Sunset Cliffs (San Diego) during negative tide which is the only time you can enter the caves without wading in chest-deep water. This was my first time there and I was impressed by the beauty of the place. Farewell to the Encina power plant. During 2021, Carlsbad residents have witnessed the long farewell to the Encina power plant. Yes, it has always been a boxy eyesore next to the beach but it has also been a presence in Carlsbad for over 60 years and its tall smokestack could be seen from places along the coast many miles around. One time, while hiking in Palomar Mountain years ago, I stumbled on a coin operated telescope. I pointed it to the coast more than 40 miles away and the only distinguishable landmarks were the Encina power plant and the lagoons. Farewell power plant. Let's hope whatever the Carlsbad City Council allows in its place does not turn out to be an even worse choice that brings more traffic congestion to our beaches. This is the view of the rocks I was standing on in the picture above taken from the road that runs along the strike valley. I took the picture a couple of days later when the weather had changed to cloudy.","tags":"","url":"index.html","UUID":"EF9FE055E838471785BBD8CF2295D0A8"}]};
